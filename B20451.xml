            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nor is there any attribute of <hi>Juſtice</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:200520:3"/> which <hi>Grotius</hi> there aſcribes to Your Uncle, but is as properly or more due to Your Majeſty. For, if <hi>Lewis</hi> were juſt, becauſe above any thing which might be ſpoken, he did honor the memory of the great King his Father, by imitating him; how juſt then is Your Majeſty, when as not all the ſtorms of adverſe fortune in Your Father or Self, could ever any ways ſhake the conſtant veneration You have always paid his Saintlike memory, by imitating him; whereas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity did almoſt ever fill the ſails of Your Uncle and his great Father! If he were juſt, becauſe he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his Brother by all means, but moſt by his own example; then is not Your Majeſty leſs juſt, who by all means, but moſt by Your own Example, hath ſo well inſtructed Your Brethren, that they in all reſpects anſwer the dignity of their high extraction, and whoſe eminent Virtues have attained ſuch a height of perfection, that they are juſtly celebrated all over Chriſtendom with admiration! If he were juſt, becauſe he did adorn his Siſters with higheſt matrimonies; (yet certainly it was rather the felicity of his fortune, then acts of his juſtice, that he was by the marriage of his Siſters allied to all the greateſt Hereditary Princes of Chriſtendom:) how juſt then is your Majeſty, who hath ſo adorned Juſtice and Piety, that as being by nature wedded to theſe (though born one of the greateſt Princes of the Weſtern world) You have preferred them before the enjoyment of Three Kingdoms! If he were juſt, becauſe he did call back the almoſt buried Laws, and oppoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a Generation making haſte into worſe: Who then can expreſs Your juſtice, who hath recalled our
<pb facs="tcp:200520:3"/> buried and almoſt forgotten Laws, and who with moſt manifeſt danger, yet by Providence miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerved for your Subjects deliverance, did oppoſe your ſelf againſt the Tyranny of the moſt perverſe generation of men that ever pretended to be Chriſtians! If he were not only juſt, but alſo clement, whenas he took from his Subjects, who by ignorance of his goodnes had tranſgreſſed the bounds of their duty, nothing but the liberty of ſinning, nor did force their conſciences differing from him in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Let the world then judge and admire your juſtice and clemency, who of your own accord does refer the moſt perpetrated villany committed in the ſight of the ſun, upon the perſon of your Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not by your Subjects ignorant of his and your goodneſs, but by thoſe who had known his clemency and goodneſs, and in the worſt of their wickedneſs needed not have deſpaired of his favor, to thoſe of your Subjects neither convened nor elected by your authority! And are ſo far from taking any thing from your peccant Subjects, more then liberty of ſinnng, that you admit of a reſtitution to thoſe of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who by ſuch undue means had invaded the ſacred patrimony of Gods Church, and your Crown. And though theſe things were committed upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion; yet ſo tender is your Majeſty, that you will force no mans conſcience, not of theſe men! And if it were juſtice and mercy in your glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Uncle, in the proſperity of his fortune to relieve oppreſſed people and Princes by his authority; then was it no ways leſs juſtice and mercy in your Majeſty, that in the adverſity of your fortune, you did by all

                     </gap>ten for and in defence of Juſtice. To You, <hi>Sir,</hi> who by an indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent adminiſtration of juſt, received and known Laws, and moderating the ſeverity of them, (Your Majeſty being their Moderator, as well as Arbitrator) where it becomes impoſsible for your Subjects to fulfil them, or inconvenient to Your ſelf, or Subjects, in rigor to execute them, (if it be not your Subjects fault) ſhall not leſs, under God, confer peace and happineſs to all ſorts of them, then the Sun by its effluence does diffuſe life and light to all the various creatures of the Univerſe. This is it, which in time will reduce your wandring Subjects to the ſecure and known paths of their Allegiance, out of which they have gone aſtray: This is it, which will ſecure you from the imputation of Tyranny, and convince your adverſaries that it is not your fault in governing, but theirs in diſobeying, if hereafter they bring upon themſelves the miſeries and calamities of another Civil war: And this is that, which will evidence to the world, that then your adverſaries became enemies to your Royal Father and Self, when they firſt trod under foot the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and received Laws of their Country; and that it is, and always was the deſire of Uſurpers, who having
<pb facs="tcp:200520:4"/> no juſt title but new Oppreſsion, to introduce more new Inventions of their own, in place of the old Laws. This is it, which after your Majeſties gracious <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> for crimes paſt, will ſo ſettle the minds of your Subjects, that in the known ways of their anceſtors, they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect favor and protection from your Majeſty. This is it, which will ſo genuinely and equally ſupport your Majeſties Title, that as it is ſo derived from the loins of innumerable Royal Anceſtors, as no man can ſhew where it began, and ſo clear, that in the world no man preſumes to ſtand in competition with You; ſo is it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by received Laws of that continuance, that they have loſt their firſt original.</p>
                  <p>I preſume not, <hi>Sir,</hi> to ſay this of mine own head, to adviſe your Majeſty, much leſs have any diffidence of your Majeſties governing your Subjects any other way then by the eſtabliſhed and received Laws of the Nation, where mens vices and depraved manners do not require new ones: I deſigne no more then to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that it was not your Majeſties Father's, and your own adherence to the eſtabliſhed Laws, but the iniquity of the times, which made him a Victim, and your Sacred ſelf an Exile. Nay, in reaſon, as well as juſtice, it had been a moſt imprudent thing in either of your Majeſties to have given up the Laws to the arbitrary luſts of your Adverſaries, or any one Faction: For, ſhould either of your Majeſties have indifferently renounced the Laws to your Adverſaries, being compounded of ſuch differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and contrary humors and affections, then there was no viſible means under Heaven to have cemented them, and by conſequence your Adverſaries hoſtility and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion continued, and your own conditions no ways
<pb facs="tcp:200520:5"/> bettered or ſecured: Or ſhould either of your Majeſties have renounced the Laws, to have advanced any one Faction ſo above the reſt, and all your loyal Subjects, that their arbitrary wills and luſts ſhould have been the laws of all the reſt, and your other Subjects alſo; yet ſhould you not only have failed to have contented that Faction, (it being the nature of Faction, never to bear any grateful acknowledgment for benefits received, but on the contrary always abuſe them to their prejudice from whom they received them, and never reſt until they have made themſelves all, and their Benefactors nothing at all, or vile and miſerable) but have animated all the other Factions againſt your Majeſties and it.</p>
                  <p>To the fulfilling of all ſingular and glorious Virtues in Your Sacred perſon, is added Your being a Chriſtian King, and a Nurſing Father of the Church of Chriſt; and as if immediately ſent from Heaven to cure and repair the wounds of this moſt miſerably diſtracted Church, although Your Majeſty is deſcended from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Royal Anceſtors, who have been Nurſing Fathers of Chriſts Church; yet are you not derived from any who have had the leaſt hand in the late Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege thereof. And though, <hi>Sir,</hi> You are and ought to be a Nurſing Father of Gods Church, and a Patron and Defence againſt her ravenous and devouring Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, yet none of mortal men have been more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Sons of the Church, then Your Majeſty, and Your Saintlike Father.</p>
                  <p>How unequal, and how unjuſt then have been the ſufferings of Princes ſo juſt, ſo religious, cauſed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Your natural Subjects, and theſe pretending Conſcience? whereas no School teaches men a better
<pb facs="tcp:200520:5"/> leſſon of obedience to Princes, then the Chriſtian faith; whenas the firſt principle or foundation of Subjects o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to rightful Princes, is founded in the Law of Nature; however popular Orators and Atheiſts have, againſt all ſenſe, reaſon, nature, and all authorities of ſacred and profane Hiſtory, reſolved it into the pacts and wills of men. And conſcience always ſuppoſes ſome ſuperior law informing men to do, or not do a thing, or ſuffer, when any ſubordinate power commands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it; whereas Your perſecutors pretending con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, trod underfoot whatſoever might be called ſacred, to the attaining their ſeditious and ſacrilegious ends.</p>
                  <p>That God in his providence doth often permit the good and juſt to ſuffer perſecution, is evidently ſeen in all ages and places: But in reaſon and prudence, neither Your Majeſties Father's, nor Your own adherence to the eſtabliſhed Government of the Church, and the Rites, Liturgy, and Means thereof, in Your adverſities, when they were ſo zealouſly perſecuted by its and Your adverſaries, could be any cauſe thereof: Neither would the deſertion of it, have any ways conduced to either of Your Majeſties advantage; for, ſhould either of Your Majeſties have renounced the Church and rites thereof, ſo as to have been a Chriſtian King of ſuch Miſcreants, who (beſides that they would not be of any Chriſtian Church or ſociety) had by undue ways devoured the patrimony of the Church; yet no man in his right wits could have imagined ſuch men would long have been governed in peace, or that all other men of their factions would have been content, who had not made a prey thereof; and there was not ſufficient to content all, nor indeed any at all; or that the canine appetites of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:200520:6"/> men who had devoured the lands of the Church, would not alſo have hungred after thoſe of the Crown. Or ſhould Your Majeſty have advanced any one Faction ſo above the reſt, that it ſhould not only have tyrannized over the reſt of the Factions, but alſo Your Majeſty and the reſt of Your ſubjects; yet could it not in reaſon have been expected, that this Faction (who by all Divine and Humane laws were ſubject to a Government, founded upon our Saviour and his Apoſtles, and by a continued ſeries diſperſed over the face of Chriſtianity, until of late it became violated in ſome places of <hi>Europe</hi> by ſeditious and ſacrilegious men) ſhould ſo unjuſtly caſt off their obedience ſo rightfully due, and yet expect that their wills and luſts ſhould long be received for Laws by the reſt of the Factions, and all other of their fellow-ſubjects. But certainly, Your conſtant adherence to the Church, did proceed from the power and grace of God in You, before any prudential or moral cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding that your Majeſty is ſo conſtant a Preſerver of Chriſts Church, and Propagator of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, and that your own conſcience hath been ſo often attempted to be violated (by men of none at all indeed;) yet ſo tender is your Maieſty of other mens, that you will not force the conſcience of any of your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, pretending it. A ſtrange condeſcenſion, any one will judge, who conſiders the parties granting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting: For, ſhould your Majeſty command your Subjects any thing in derogation to the Majeſty of God, or forbid them the worſhip and ſervice of God, your Subjects might then juſtly plead conſcience, becauſe the duty and allegiance which they owe to God, is in the firſt place to be paid by all his creatures: Or ſhould your
<pb facs="tcp:200520:6"/> Majeſty command any thing which were immoral or unjuſt, as that your Subjects ſhould diſhonor your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty or their Parents, &amp;c. they might juſtly plead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, becauſe that for Subjects to honor their King, and children their Parents, is founded in Nature, and is a Law of God engraven in the minds of all mortal men; or ſhould your Majeſty have lived in the Primeve times of Chriſtianity, when men by the light of Humane Nature apprehending a Deity to be publickly Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and Served, yet being ignorant of the manner, miſplaced it in <hi>Oſyris, Iſis, Iupiter, Apollo,</hi> an <hi>Oak,</hi> &amp;c. then to have compelled them to have Worſhipped God after the manner of Chriſtians, had been unconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unchriſtian, becauſe they paid an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Worſhip due to God by Nature, and could not by Nature apprehend this, but muſt wait upon God, until (that by the ordinary means of the Church, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally inſpired by God,) they ſhould be converted thereunto: Or ſhould your Majeſty command any thing in derogation to Chriſtian Faith or Religion, they might plead Conſcience, becauſe the Obedience they owe thereunto is ſuperior to all Humane Laws: But when as God is to be publickly Worſhipped, and your Majeſty obeyed by the light of Humane Nature; whenas he that heareth, and obeyeth not the Church, is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an Infidel and Heathen man; and neither your Majeſty nor Church enjoyning any thing contrary to the Law of Nature, or Gods Will revealed in Scriptures, but conformable to theſe; for men, your natural Subjects, and Born and Baptized in a Chriſtian Church, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to all theſe, to plead Liberty of Conſcience, to be Atheiſts, Hypocrites, and Schiſmaticks, is ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
<pb facs="tcp:200520:7"/> Paradox, as is not imaginable ſhould proceed from reaſonable creatures, not aiming at ſome further miſchief: And when your Majeſty ſhall with bleeding tears reflect upon the manners of theſe men thus preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Liberty of Conſcience, you will finde them never to have made any conſcience of Liberty, their Manners no whit better then their Religion? but as great enemies to Humane Society, as Chriſtian Religion: For they no ſooner, upon pretence of Liberty of Conſcience, got licence of action, but what followed; Rapine, Plunder, Sequeſtration, Sacriledge, Regicidiſm and Murder, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Eſtates of the Church, Crown, and the Sacred Perſon of your Royal Father, and the principal members of Church and State, who were your beſt and moſt Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and their Fellow-Subjects: when as by the Law, or Light of Nature, no man ought to do that willingly to another, which he would not have done to himſelf. Nor is this humor only Topical, or confined within the limits of your Dominion; but whereſoever men would not pay the Duty they ought to God in the firſt Table, they have never better perform'd that to their neighbor in the ſecond, although it hath not pleaſed God to permit them to attain ſuch a degree of Impiety, as here in your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Dominions; and your Majeſty may believe it, that the times are changed, not theſe mens manners and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, to attempt the like again whenſoever they get an opportunity; however, theſe things at preſent will be better cured by your Majeſties Chriſtian Patience and example, then by your ſevere Execution of the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Laws againſt them; yet if the Laborer be worthy of his Hire, then is he who is Hired worthy to Labor; and theſe men who pretending Conſcience, neglect or
<pb facs="tcp:200520:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> refuſe to perform the Duties of the Church, are utterly unworthy the Means of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Mans neceſsity is Gods oportunity: It is Gods uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way in his Providence (doubtleſs to manifeſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Power to us Mortals here below) when mens extremities are at the higheſt, then to relieve them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it may be, the leaſt reaſons or hope to expect it; and indeed what leſs then the power and grace of God in a Chriſtian Prince, ſo Religious, ſo Juſt, ſo Merciful, and ſo deſcended, at ſuch a time, could have cured the wide wounds of our miſerable Church, and diſtracted State? <hi>D'avila</hi> reports of <hi>Coligny</hi> the Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> that he would uſually prefer himſelf before <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> becauſe they acquired greatneſs by proſperous Fortune; whereas notwithſtanding that Fortune was always ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to him, he ſtill roſe more formidable and terrible to his adverſaries: Sure it is an admirable thing, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the adverſity of your Affairs, God ſhould without force or blood, exalt your Sacred Head above the Storms and Waves of ſuch Enemies, who had neither Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Law, Juſtice or Reaſon, but only force and blood in ſtead of, and againſt theſe, to maintain their Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>It cannot but be a conſolation to any man in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, rightly conſidering, how God (in the ordinary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things,) does afflict men who place happineſs in things of this world, and reward the afflictions of men (eſpecially who ſuffer for a good Conſcience) even in this world; for no man placeing happineſs in things here below, can ſo enjoy them, but neceſſarily a time will come when he ſhall ſay, I take no pleaſure in them; and then it will be <hi>miſerum fuiſſe beatum;</hi> whereas other men who are afflicted, and ſuffer perſecution, are no ways
<pb facs="tcp:200520:8"/> affrighted at the terrors of death, but rather with joy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect happineſs in another world, after they ſhall be freed from the cares and troubles of this; or if it pleaſes God to free them from their afflictions here, then they truly convert <hi>miſerum fuiſſe beatum,</hi> into <hi>beatum fuiſſe miſerum.</hi> Beſides your Majeſties individual happineſs in making ſo right conſtruction of your precedent affections, and the advantages you have acquired by your ſevere education therein; your Subjects (like men who have been long ſick, will better learn to eſteem health) from their many ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in your abſence, will for the future learn to ſet a truer eſtimation upon your Proſperity and Preſence. And may the God of Peace, the God of Mercy, and the God of Juſtice, ſo Crown the antecedent adverſe fortune of You, Sir, the moſt Peaceable, the moſt Merciful, Juſt, and beſt of Princes, that being as Good and Juſt as <hi>Trajan,</hi> and as Devout and Religious as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, or <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the firſt, you may be of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as beloved as was <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the Arbitrator of Chriſtendom, as well as Defender of the Chriſtian Faith: And when this your Diadem ſhall deſcend to your next Heir, you may then aſſume a Celeſtial one, which ſhall never be ſubject to time, variation, or chance: Which is, and always ſhall be the daily Payer of,</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have often with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration conſidered in my ſelf, how that all men, good and bad, rich and poor, noble and ignoble, have with one voice commended Virtue, and decried Vice; and yet ſcarce any man in a thouſand hath made Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue the rule or reaſon of his actions. Nor is it a thing leſs worth admiration to conſider, how that all men generally have not only a natural ſpight againſt their Superiors, and are unwilling to obey them, but alſo a propenſe deſire to attain to Liberty, and do tread under foot all things which may be called ſacred, to the attaining thereof; and yet at no time or place in the world, did ever men accompliſh it. I did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude with my ſelf, that not only all Moral Virtue, but Humane Society, did proceed from higher then any humane, or voluntary cauſes.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:200520:10"/>
                  <p> Nor was that leſs abhorrent to me, which men in this factious age beg for a Principle, <hi>viz. That all men by Nature, or the Law of Nature, are in a like equal condition; and that the Laws of Nature are eternal, and immutable even by God himſelf:</hi> And yet by a continued violence upon theſe eternal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Laws, men ſhould every where in the world live in Society, or in the mutual offices of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obeying.</p>
                  <p>Yet did not I ſo confidently reſolve theſe things, as to exclude what I could argue againſt them: I therefore did ſuppoſe in my ſelf a company of ſuch men, as were in a parity of condition; yet could I never conceive it poſsible that ever any <hi>Civitas</hi> or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power could be derived or created by them: For either this <hi>Civitas</hi> muſt be ſuperior to the <hi>Cives</hi> or People that made it, or not: If it were not ſuperior to it, then could it not govern or rule them; for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is always placed in the ſuperior part: If ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to it, then was the Creature or Inſtrument ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the Cauſe and Creator, which is moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. Nor was it to me leſs monſtrous to imagine, that any thing could give or transfer that to another, which it ſelf hath not; but this people or multitude, who ſhould make this <hi>civitas,</hi> had neither <hi>Jus vitae</hi> or <hi>necis,</hi> nor Property ſeperately nor conjunctly; they could not therefore endue another with that power, which none of them, nor all of them together had, and without which, there can be no ſupream power which may protect and defend Subjects.</p>
                  <p>But I did not inſiſt onely upon this, but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the <hi>cives</hi> could make a <hi>civitas,</hi> which ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:200520:10"/> be ſuperior to them, and endew it with a power which none of them, nor all of them had; yet was I no leſs perplexed then before, who theſe <hi>cives,</hi> which ſhould make this civil Pact ſhould be? and who ſhould be ſubject to it? If onely thoſe be the <hi>cives,</hi> who made this <hi>civitas,</hi> and they onely ſubject to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then were Women and Children, who were none of the <hi>cives</hi> that made this <hi>civitas</hi> free and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from it: Nor could all the people or multitude of both Sexes, and all Ages, in ſuch an imaginary ſtate, be the <hi>cives</hi> which muſt conſtitute this <hi>civitas</hi> by virtue of the civil Pact: For many muſt neceſſarily be ſo yong, as not being <hi>compotes mentium,</hi> they could have underſtanding ſufficient for the doing ſuch an act: And if no Laws oblige Men to their Pacts and Contracts done under ſuch an age, then ſure it muſt be unreaſonable, that Children and Infants ſhould be obliged to their act, if they then did it; or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obliged, becauſe others had done it, upon whom they had no dependence.</p>
                  <p>Well, but ſuppoſe theſe men in ſuch a condition to be qualified to do ſuch an act, yet did another doubt ariſe, which I could no ways ſalve, <hi>viz. Who ſhould define at what age the Men ſhould be, who ſhould conſtitute this</hi> civitas? Well, I went yet further, I ſuppoſed it granted, That it ſhould be agreed at what age Men in ſuch a condition might give up their wills, and conſtitute a <hi>civitas;</hi> yet was it not in reaſon probable, that this <hi>civitas</hi> ſhould be of one days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: For being formally conſtituted of ſuch indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual <hi>cives,</hi> it could not be of any longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance then the cauſe, <hi>Sublata cauſa, tollitur &amp; effectus;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:200520:11"/> but the next day, ſome of the <hi>cives</hi> would be probably dead, and others grown up to be of age, who were none of thoſe individuals which did conſtitute the <hi>civitas.</hi> Well, but I ſuppoſed the <hi>cives</hi> who made <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Formae rerum ſicut numeri conſiſtunt in indiviſibili.</hi> They could not therefore be the <hi>cives,</hi> that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas,</hi> and by conſequence no ſuch could remain as the <hi>civitas.</hi>
                     </note> this <hi>civitas</hi> to be immortal, and no poſterity; yet could not I in reaſon expect it to be of any continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for <hi>cujus eſt velle, ejus eſt nolle,</hi> and not onely all juſt and legal actions, but all Arts and Sciences, may truly and ultimately be reſolved into their firſt Principles, without any diminution to them. The People therefore conſtant in nothing but inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, could not in reaſon be expected conſtant and obedient to their Creature the <hi>civitas</hi> onely, and yet ſo in nothing elſe: Beſides, I always did believe, and yet do, that all Mens Pacts and Wills muſt be conformable to the Laws of every place, and where they are againſt them, then do they oblige no further then to Repentance: Much more therefore ought all mens Wills and Pacts, to conform and ſubmit to the Laws of Nature, and never tranſgreſs that; and that all Pacts and Acts of mens Wills made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, oblige to nothing but Repentance: Nor is there any thing more abominable, then to conceive that the Acts of mens Wills ſhould irritate the Law of Nature, which they ſay is immutable by God. Hence it is, I conceive, that Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> will not have all men to be of a like and equal condition <hi>lege natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae,</hi> but <hi>jure naturae;</hi> and therefore moſt abſurdly makes <hi>jus naturae,</hi> to be contrary to <hi>lex naturae</hi> (and yet oftentimes in his <hi>Preface,</hi> and <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Art.</hi> 10. confounds <hi>jus</hi> with <hi>lex)</hi> and that the Acts of mens Wills, to make them in a better eſtate then God hath made them,
<pb facs="tcp:200520:11"/> ſhould be the Law of Nature, or of God: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, If no man that ever was born in the World, which was not a <hi>Poſthumus King,</hi> but was born in ſubjection, not onely to his Parents, or as a Servant in a Family, but to ſomething ſuperior to theſe; then cannot the will of that man, nor all the men in the World, alter or make that man in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other condition then that, whereof neither any act of his will, nor the will of any man elſe, was the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>But yet did not I conclude things, onely as I was an intellectual or rational Creature; but being a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, I ſubmitted all my Reaſon and Underſtanding to the moſt high Authority of ſacred Scripture, in thoſe plain places which admit of no Controverſie, where both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the firſt cauſes of ſupream Power are owned to be Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>

                  <p>But becauſe I would not ſeem to ſee only with mine own eyes, I deſired yet to be better informed of theſe things, and from whom better then Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> (Men no doubt of as eminent learning and parts, as any this laſt Age hath produced) theſe Men both derive their <hi>civitas</hi> from ſuch Principles, as is before ſpoken of, <hi>viz. From the Pacts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of Men in a parity and equal condition;</hi> but ſo far was I from being convinced, that (if I underſtand them aright) I was amazed to ſee ſuch inconſiſtible and impoſsible things to come from Men, otherwiſe ſo learned.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:200520:12"/>
                  <p> For though Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> does lay down his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and perſue his method much more clearly then <hi>Grotius</hi> does; yet his Principles are ſo monſtrous, That to me it is impoſsible any ingenuous Man ſhould aſſent to them. Indeed if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would have ſuppoſed, that the ſtate of Man had been either in Society, or out of Society; and that, out of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Men had been in ſuch a ſtate as he makes them, in his ſtate of pure Nature, I ſhould never have ſtumbled at it: But, he forſooth, requires it for a <note place="margin">Yet thus much I will tell Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> he may as wel ſuppoſe a Brute an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual or rational Creature; or a man, no intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as no ſociable, or out of Society.</note> Principle, <hi>That all Men</hi> jure naturali, <hi>are in a pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and equal condition, and may kill one another without any offence or ſin; and that Men continue in this eſtate, until by their civil Pact, they oblige themſelves to one another, that the will of the</hi> civitas <hi>ſhall be the will of them all.</hi> Notwithſtanding this, I muſt needs ſay of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> That if Men have ſo little underſtanding, as to make <hi>Jus naturale</hi> to be contrary to <hi>Lex naturalis,</hi> and ſo little grace as to believe that the <hi>civitas</hi> hath all its power from the Pacts and wills of Men, and yet impoſsible to command any thing contrary to the Law of Nature (which he ſays is the Law of God) and tyranny to be onely <hi>ab exercitio,</hi> when as it is impoſsible for Kings to command any thing contrary to the Law of Nature; and all Faith and Ghoſtly Power which our Saviour left in his Church, to be inſtrumental and ſubſervient to it; and never look how little he underſtands a Pact, or from whence Men become obliged to it; the <hi>cives</hi> of this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia</hi> may do well enough.</p>
                  <p>If I edified but little by Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> yet I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much leſs ſatisfaction from <hi>Grotius;</hi> for Mr.
<pb facs="tcp:200520:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                     <hi>Hobbs</hi> defines his terms ſo clearly, as to me, he was eaſily underſtood; whereas all <hi>Grotius</hi> his Principles are ſo perplexed, and equivocal, that it is not poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any Man to underſtand any thing clearly from him. As the firſt thing in his <hi>Preface,</hi> he confounds, is, <hi>Societas &amp; Communitas;</hi> whereas <hi>Societas</hi> is as different from <hi>Communitas,</hi> as black is from white; <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietas,</hi> according to the definition of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> being <note place="margin">Pol. lib. 1. cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num quid it a constans ex diverſis perſonis, ut ſit unum quod imperet, alterum quod pareat.</hi> Society is one thing ſo made up of divers perſons, that one may command, another obey; Whereas community is, where any company of Creatures are, without the offices of commanding and obeying.</p>
                  <p>Well, but having got out of his <hi>Preface,</hi> after ſome Propoſitions of his Method, &amp;c. he in the Tenth Paragraph of the Firſt Chapter of the Firſt Book <hi>De jure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> defines <hi>Jus Naturale</hi> in a tedious general thing, to be <hi>dictatum rectae rationis, &amp;c.</hi> and this to be the Law of God; and about the middle, to be immutable by God himſelf; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end, to continue but for a certain ſpace; and towards the beginning he makes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which is now in uſe, to be brought in by the will of Man, and this to be <hi>Jus Naturale</hi> too. Now let any ingenuous Man judge, what can be clearly deduced from <hi>Jus Naturale,</hi> which is the Law of God, and immutable by God; and yet to continue but for a certain time, until a Dominion brought in by the will of Man, ſhould abrogate what was immutable by God; and this Dominion thus brought in againſt this <hi>Jus Naturale,</hi> to be
<pb facs="tcp:200520:13"/> 
                     <hi>Jus Naturale</hi> too. If I have ſlandered <hi>Grotius,</hi> let any Man ſee the Paragraph aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>It was to me an admirable thing to conſider, that men ſo learned, ſhould one of them define the Law of Nature to be <hi>Dictamen rectae rationis,</hi> the other <hi>Dictatum rectae rationis.</hi> Well, I will therefore ſee what <hi>Ratiocinatio</hi> is, and what <hi>Dictamen,</hi> or <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum rectae rationis</hi> (which is the ſame thing;) and whether this can to any ingenuous man be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable definition of the Law of Nature.</p>

Theſe Principles for which no Reaſon can be given, and yet the reaſon of all thoſe things which can be deduced from them, are called <hi>Axiomata, Dignitates,</hi> or <hi>Communes No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones;</hi> and from theſe, men by Ratiocination or Right Reaſon, do infer Arts and Sciences <note n="a" place="margin">

                     </note>: Nay, all Ratiocination or Right reaſoning whatſoever, may be reſolved into ſomewhat which is ſuperior to this Ratiocination; for which no reaſon can be given <note n="*" place="margin">Theſe things thus premiſed, I ſay it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be the dictate of Right Reaſon, and thus I prove it; Every Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which does conſtitute Ratiocination, and for which no Reaſon can be given, is no dictate of Right Reaſon. But the Law of Nature is a Principle which does conſtitute Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination; and for which no reaſon can be given; Therefore the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of Right Reaſon. If Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> denies the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſet him ſhew into what it can be further reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or what can prove it: For though God be the prime and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of all things, but what proceeds from the will of man, and into which, all things may be ultimately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; yet by Principles <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and all Philoſophers, underſtand thoſe things which immediately proceed from God; and the Law of Nature could not be the Law of God, if it did not immediately proceed from him; but the Law of that thing from which it did immediately proceed; the Law of Nature therefore is a Principle.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Well, but let us ſuppoſe the Law of Nature to be the dictate of Right Reaſon, and ſee the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Every dictate of Right Reaſon, is of leſs Dignity, Authority, and Excellency, then the Right Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> The Effect, then the Cauſe: But <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> the Law of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law of God the Creator, is the dictate of Right Reaſon. Therefore is the Law of the Creator, of leſs Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb facs="tcp:200520:13"/> authority and excellency, then the faculty and attribute of the creature, <hi>viz.</hi> Right reaſon; then which what can be more monſtrous and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous?</p>
                  <p>Nor is this definition leſs ridiculous, then impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and blaſphemous: For the dictates of Right reaſon are underſtood by one man, and not by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and may be learned and taught. Suppoſe now, one of theſe Maſters of Reaſon ſhould come to the moſt plain and ignorant man in the world, (who is <hi>compos mentis)</hi> and tell him, he would inſtruct and teach him the moſt excellent dictate of Reaſon in the world, <hi>viz. That there is one God infinitely good, who is to be worſhiped and ſerved by man; And that this God requires of every man, that in that ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath made him, he would not willingly do that to another, which he would not have done to himſelf:</hi> would not this poor ignorant man deride this Maſter of Reaſon, and tell him, he knew this, as well as himſelf? But ſuppoſe he ſhould be ſo impudent as to deny this; ſince <hi>Grotius</hi> is not in caſe, I would deſire Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> to prove it, or give a right reaſon thereof, and learn this man his Dictate of Right reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Well, but let us ſee whether this Canting thing be worth the name of a Definition. <hi>Omnis definitio; eſt excluſio aequivoci.</hi> If the Law of Nature be the Dictate of Right reaſon, then does the Law of Nature exclude every thing elſe from being the Dictate of Right reaſon, or this cannot be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of it: I would know now of Mr. <hi>Hobbs;</hi> whether all Arts and Sciences, and Prudent actions, be the Laws of Nature, or not? If they be the Laws
<pb facs="tcp:200520:14"/> of Nature, then is every Inſcientifical and Imprudent man, an Unjuſt man. If they be not the Laws of Nature, and ſo not the Dictates of Right reaſon, then let Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſhew what elſe does dictate them. Nor is Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> leſs happy in defining a <hi>Pact,</hi> upon which he grounds his <hi>Civitas.</hi> It is juſt therefore that this man, who <hi>(Cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Art.</hi> 4.) makes all Science to be from Definitions only, or Subjects without Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, (without which it is impoſsible there can be a Propoſition) and all Science to be from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory (which is common to all Beaſts, as well as <hi>Mr. Hobbs;</hi> for ſo the <hi>Oxe knows his owner, and the Aſs his maſters crib,</hi> it being only retained in the memory) excluding the Underſtanding, ſhould ſo raſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine things, and underſtand them no better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To believe there is a God to be worſhiped and ſerved; and that no man ſhould wilfully, in that ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein God hath made him, do that to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which he would not have done to himſelf;</hi> is that Law which God hath engraven in the mindes of all mortal men, wiſe and unwiſe, learned and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, noble and ignoble, in their wits, and is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and baſis of all Humane ſociety: And this is that firſt and univerſal cauſe, from which all moral virtues (the dictates of Right reaſon from this cauſe) do more genuinely and naturally flow, then any Propoſition in Geometry does from the Axiomes or Principles of it: For what man is there in this world, of what eſtate and condition ſoever, but deſires not to be wronged and injured? Let not him then in that ſtate, wilfully wrong or injure any other of what eſtate ſoever. If he be a Subject, and deſires to
<pb facs="tcp:200520:14"/> be protected in his life and fortune, by the Laws of his Country, from the violence and oppreſsion of other men; let not him abuſe or violate the Laws of his Country, to the wrong or oppreſsion of another. If he deſires every man ſhould keep promiſe, and do juſtly by him; let not him break his word, and deal unjuſtly with another. Is he a King? he would not willingly be diſſeiſed or oppreſſed by another; let him not therefore diſſeiſe or injuſtly oppreſs another. Does any King deſire not to be invaded or oppreſſed by his Subjects? let not him therefore oppreſs his Subjects. If he had been a Subject, he would have deſired protection from his Prince, by an equal and moderate diſtribution of known Laws; let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore equally moderately govern his Subjects by known Laws. And from this Law did always men deſire, though ignorant of the manner, to worſhip and ſerve GOD, although they miſplaced the Deity in the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> an <hi>Oak, Apollo, Jupiter,</hi> &amp;c. And this is that Law which ſhall judge and condemn the immoral actions and vices of men in all Ages, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this latter Age, becauſe they ſinned againſt the Light or Law of Nature, engraven in the minds of all men.</p>
                  <p>Now whether theſe men being Chriſtians in name, yet having caſt off all Chriſtian ſociety, and not being of any Chriſtian church or religion that I ever heard of, ſhould not be content here; but (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſcarce agree in any thing elſe) proceed ſo far as to make the Laws of God ſubject and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the reaſons and phantaſies of men; and not to tell them where their reaſons ſhall begin,
<pb facs="tcp:200520:15"/> if not at the Laws of God, but every man left to go a whoring after his own inventions? For what can then reſtrain man, where his Reaſon is become ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the Laws of God? and to make all humane ſociety to have its origination from the pacts and wills of men; have not been as great enemies not only to Chriſtian religion, but alſo to all humane ſociety, as the malice of the Devil could invent, let any ſober unbiaſſed man judge? or if all the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and diſtractions in Chriſtendom (to the ſhame and ſcandal of Chriſtianity) have not had their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination from this pretence? Nor hath this ſenſleſs reſolution of all things into Reaſon, ended only in the diſtractions of State, but alſo been the firſt ſource and fountain from whence all theſe diſtractions and confuſions in the Church have ariſen, without any poſsible hope of ever reconciling them, where theſe principles are continued. Hence it is, that the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and higheſt Authority of the ſacred Scriptures, are become the ſubject of all Tavern-diſcourſes; and every man that ſcarce underſtands any reaſon, muſt (forſooth) have a reaſon given him, why the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are the Word of God. And yet in all other Authorities whatſoever, men will deride the folly of others, who go about to prove them by Reaſon; for Reaſon is begotten alwaies from Authorities and Principles, and therefore cannot Authorities and Principles be begotten from Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>I have been often almoſt aſtoniſhed to conſider, how ſuch ſenſleſs, blaſphemous, and ridiculous things ſhould meerly from the authority of the Aſſertors be impoſed upon, and received by the world without
<pb facs="tcp:200520:15"/> contradiction; whereas narrowly looked into, one would ſcarce believe the Authors had ever underſtood Logick, or one leaf in <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> And for my part, if I could not ultimately reſolve the Dictates of my Reaſon as a Chriſtian, into plain places of Scripture, ſo well as any Geometrician could any Propoſition of Geometry into the Principles of <hi>Euclids</hi> Elements; I would be content to let them wander for ever without any termination, rather then admit them (the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures) to be a creature of a creature, and the ſubject of every wild phantaſtical conceit and opinion. And if I could not ultimately reſolve the reaſon of all my moral actions as a man, into the Law of Nature which God has engraven in mens minds, and not into the wills of men; I would be content to conclude with <hi>Carneades,</hi> that men have at divers times eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſeveral Laws for manners, and by them have been often altered, but that there is no ſuch thing as the Law of Nature; and that all men, as well as other creatures, are naturally carried to their profits: And ſo there is no ſuch thing as Juſtice; or if there were, it were the greateſt folly, becauſe men by endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good of others, prejudice themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Since the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were the firſt, who in the world did make all power to be from the People; I ſuppoſe that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> took their Principles from them. Let us ſee whether by the People they underſtand the ſame thing with the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> or the ſame thing with one another. By the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Athens,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> underſtood them, and them only, who were <hi>civitate donati,</hi> and not men born
<pb facs="tcp:200520:16"/> in a promiſcuous rout and parity, without all order and ſubordination; but made ſo by violent uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By the People, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> underſtands the King or Court governing. By the People, <hi>Grotius</hi> every where (I believe, for he no where that I can find, defines the People) underſtands the Subjects governed, and they who in a parity or equal condition conſtituted the <hi>Civitas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon theſe and many other conſiderations and obſervations upon them, I was ſo far from being convinc'd, that I became much more firmly eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed then before in my Judgment, (for Opinion I will not have of thoſe things, wherein I am poſſeſt of the conſtant practice of the world in all ages &amp; places; the plain, undubitable, and uncontrolled places of Scripture both in the Old and New Teſtament, and no colour of allegation againſt them from any other places; the Authority of the higheſt Philoſopher; my Country-Laws; and all thoſe Theſes and Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes upon which almoſt all Reaſon and Philoſophy are grounded; and theſe things oppoſed by ſuch monſtrous, feigned, equivocal and ſilly beggings of the queſtion, which no man, not blinded with facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſtupid ignorance, can grant) yet had not theſe Obſervations become publique, if it had not been upon an odd occaſion, which was:</p>
                  <p>Upon a time being with a Brother-in-law, a Kinſman of mine (at dinner) came to my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; where, in diſcourſe, he asked me if I had ſeen a Book of <hi>Tho. Whites,</hi> called <hi>The Grounds of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Government?</hi> I anſwered no, nor did I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee any thing of his doing, having conceived a
<pb facs="tcp:200520:16"/> prejudice of the Mans ability and ingenuity. He confidently replied, that I ſhould be convinced, if I did but read it, and that he would ſend me the book. Yet was I ſo far from accepting his courteſie, that I importunately deſired him not to do it: But he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all importunity, on purpoſe ſent his man with it that night to me, being at that time much afflicted with my wonted Melancholy, which became more excited when I had read ſome part of it: And ſeeing a thing ſo ſenſleſs and void of all humanity, to be impoſed upon the world, (which queſtionleſs was intended to prefer ſome Faction or Intereſt of his;) and yet forſooth he tells us, it is a ſecond Edition cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and amended by the Author; (whereſoever therefore I name our <hi>Author,</hi> I mean <hi>Tho. White</hi> Gent.) I did in deteſtation of the Thing (not of the Man, for I never ſaw him in all my life) ſet my ſelf to make theſe Obſervations upon it.</p>
                  <p>He harps upon the ſame ſtring with Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi> That <hi>all Supreme Power is originally cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by Mens wills ſubject to it:</hi> Yet being a fine Gentleman <hi>in quirpo,</hi> he dances a Galliard by himſelf, and moſt ſenſeleſly makes men out of ſociety to be a Rational multitude, and to have Property before they had Laws or Government, and to be a People after they had given up their power to another to govern them. But leſt it ſhould be objected, that though our <hi>Author</hi> be hood-winked, yet Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> might be very clear-ſighted and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, I thought it not amiſs to make theſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon them alſo. As a Preparative to a Purge, I pray <hi>(Reader)</hi> take theſe few Notes.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb facs="tcp:200520:17"/> 1. Firſt I ſay, they falſly derive Government: For though they all differ in the manner of it, yet is all Government ſo far from being ſo derived as any of them would have it, in the firſt Inſtitution, that if any of them can ſhew any one Government ſo derived ſince the beginning of the world, I will yeeld the cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They feign that for a Principle, which never was, <hi>viz. That men by nature are in a parity or equal condition:</hi> For never were men ſince the Creation, in any age or place of the world, in ſuch a condition. But ſuppoſe ſomewhere in the world it might have been found, that men in a like condition did by their acts and wills form themſelves into a Society; yet is it a moſt unreaſonable thing to conclude from thence, that all power in Government is from the People: For, Singulars are deduced and concluded from Univerſals; not Univerſals by Singulars.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Principle they beg, is deſtructive to all good manners; for, Juſtice is the fountain of all humane Virtues and Morality, (as all Philoſophers, and beſt, and wiſeſt men hold:) And if Juſtice be the duty which men owe their Superiors, and that it may be truly and ultimately reſolved into the firſt cauſe, without any detriment or damage to it; and if all order, ſuperiority, and power in Government may truly and ultimately be reſolved into the People, or the wills of the Subjects, or Party governed; then the wills of the Subjects being the fountain and firſt cauſe of all Order and Juſtice, that is Juſtice in the People, to do what they liſt; then which, nothing can be more deſtructive to all Virtue, Juſtice, and Good manners.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb facs="tcp:200520:17"/> 4. It is damnably deſtructive to Faith; for, <hi>All powers are of God,</hi> Rom. 13. and, <hi>No power can be given but from above,</hi> S. John 19. 11.</p>
                  <p>Nor were theſe Men, when they wrote their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Treatiſes, <hi>De Cive, De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> and <hi>Grounds of Obedience and Government;</hi> much better in their Religion (if I conceive a right Notion of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is <hi>Actus Divini cultus,</hi> or the Publick worſhip and ſervice of God, in an unity, form and communion) then their Writings ſhew them to be for Juſtice and Government. For though our <hi>Author</hi> be a Pretender to be of the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet it would trouble the greateſt Critique of this Age to ſhew where the Religion of either of the other were to be found. And who but ſuch men as theſe, would pin their faith upon the tales and fictions of Poets, before the moſt venerable and ſacred Authority of Holy Scripture? Nor can the eldeſt of Poets writings be compared in antiquity with the Scriptures: For if it could,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Cur ſupra bellum Thebanum, &amp; funera Trojae,</l>

                  <p>And the <hi>Theban</hi> and <hi>Trojan</hi> War hapned after the Year of the World 2750.

Raleigh Hiſt. World, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>ſect.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>For my part, if in waſhing off the <hi>Fucus</hi> with which theſe men have obſcured the true cauſes of all
<pb facs="tcp:200520:18"/> Society, and hath no colour of veriſimilitude in it, the truth of all Humane, Chriſtian, and Legal ſociety may more clearly appear from their natural and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine cauſes; I ſhall then not think my time and pains utterly loſt, which otherwiſe I ſhould.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, that I have tranſgreſſed the bounds of Civility in theſe Obſervations upon Mr. <hi>White;</hi> and that ſuch oppoſing is rather like to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe differences, then reconcile them: I anſwer, that if Mr. <hi>White</hi> (or at leaſt to my underſtanding) had not propounded ſome baſe Faction or Intereſt, and not any Good intentions, to have been his end by this Diſcourſe of the <hi>Grounds of Obedience and Government;</hi> Or if he would have been content to have made it his own caſe only, I ſhould have been content to have taken no notice of it. But ſince he is not only content to proſtitute all Virtue and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in himſelf; and not ſtay there, but make this publique, and all men who are not of his opinion, not to be <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gro.</hi> 16. end.</note> worthy the name of <hi>Men;</hi> ſure it is rather to be expected he ſhould be ſeverely reprehended, and his abſurdities ſo detected, that they may be avoided by other men, then to be hoped that ever he ſhould be reclaimed from them.</p>
                  <p>Note, neither <hi>Grotius</hi> nor our <hi>Author</hi> make any Government, but only <hi>Monarchy,</hi> to be diſſolvible: For if the Supremacie be once veſted in a many-headed-Beaſt, be it <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> then are they ſo ſacred and inviolable, that neither of them have one word, in what cauſes they forfeit their Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And though <hi>Grotius</hi> no where ſo defines the <hi>People,</hi> as any man may underſtand any thing by it;
<pb facs="tcp:200520:18"/> yet ſure by the People they mean (if they mean any thing) the Subjects of any Prince or State. Suppoſe therefore that the People may diſſolve Government, as oft as they ſee occaſion; yet if the People be <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num quid,</hi> made up of all the individual Subjects of any Prince, then muſt the depoſing of any Prince, if it be the act of the People, be the act of every individual Subject; which is a thing never done, nor will be unto the end of the world. All <hi>Grotius,</hi> and our <hi>Authors</hi> Neceſsities and Reaſons therefore for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Princes by the People, are meer Cantings, and invented only to nurſe up Factions in the World without end, until <hi>Monarchy</hi> or <hi>Regal power</hi> ſhould be extirpated in all the World.</p>

Becauſe without memory there can be no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is nothing elſe but multiplied memory: in like manner me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory cannot be, without permanence of the thing perceived: and the thing perceived cannot remain in what it never was, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But <hi>multi multa, nemo omnia vidit.</hi> I do not think that all light of underſtanding was ſo ſhut up in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> braine, that all things pronounced <note place="margin">Apology.</note> by him, are to be taken for granted Principles; yet do I entertain ſo vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that I do admire him, as the moſt eminent of all men, in all humane learning, among the Ancients; and not to be paralleld by any of the Moderns: but <hi>inventis addere,</hi> is one of the chiefeſt ends of Mans being; and there are yet, and ſo will be until the end of the World, many things received for truth, which upon more ſearch will be found but veriſimilitudes; and infinite things hidden from our Forefathers, which will be infinitely found out by the preſent and ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent generation; that the Infinity of God may appear, as well to the preſent and ſubſequent age, as to the antecedent, in all his works.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Well then, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies, and the Doctor ſubſcribes to it, that <note place="margin">All things were nor in the ſenſes, before they are in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the Doctor.</note> 
                     <hi>Nihil eſt intellectu, quod non prius fuerit in ſenſu.</hi> I deny that there is nothing in the underſtanding, which was not firſt in the ſenſes: for there are many things intelligible, which are not ſenſible; as time does, every article of it, intelligibly paſs away, not ſenſibly. I underſtand that the centre of a circle, is a point; and that a point, by the definition of it, <hi>eſt cujus nulla pars eſt;</hi> it cannot therefore according to the true definition of it, be ſo expreſſed, as to be the object of ſenſe. So a right line is <hi>longitudo, latitudinis expers;</hi> but neither a right line nor a point can be truly repreſented to the ſenſe, according to the truth of them, as they ariſe in the underſtanding; and ſo two right, or ſuppoſed right lines, which are not parallel, cannot be infinitely produced according to ſenſe, but they will cut one another; but intelligibly they may; for no Man can underſtand ſo ſmall a quantity of diſtance, before the interſection, but I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:200520:20"/> a ſmaller, and another ſmaller then that, and ſo <hi>ad infinitum;</hi> and ſo <hi>Quantitas diviſibilis eſt in ſemper diviſibila, &amp; poteſt infinitè augeri, &amp; minui;</hi> but this is only intelligibly, it cannot be actually or ſenſibly done; and ſo the <hi>contactus</hi> of a right line with a circle, is a point in the underſtanding, and not ſenſibly; and ſo is the touching of two circles, either within one another, or without. Nay, neither Art, Science, nor any rational pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction whatſoever <hi>a priori,</hi> but muſt neceſſarily be in the underſtanding before it can be in the ſenſes. I underſtand Animal to comprehend not only the Creatures I have ſeen, but all thoſe which are, were, or ever ſhall be; and ſo I underſtand things equal to a third thing, are equal to one another; yet nor I, nor any Man elſe ever ſaw two things equal to a third; and the whole body of Geometry is of all Sciences moſt intelligible, and yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from all ſenſible matter.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If it be true that both <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the Doctor affirm, that all <note place="margin">No Art or Science ariſes from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note> Art and Science is acquired from the receiving a thing into the ſenſes, and that from the permanence of the thing in the ſenſe the memory is made; and from the multiplication of the memory, Experience; and from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, the Principles of all Art and Science, and that it be true which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies, to which the Doctor ſubſcribes, <hi>Fit ex memoriâ, experientia hominibus: multae etenim ejuſdem res memoriae, unius experientiae vim efficiunt.</hi>

                     <hi>Quare experientia pene ſimile quid ſcientiae ac arti eſſe videtur;</hi> then does it moſt evidently and perſpicuouſly follow, that he that can longeſt retain things in his ſenſe, that is, hath the beſt memory, is the moſt ſcientifical, and moſt artificial Man: whereas we daily ſee that the Man that hath the greateſt memory, is uſually a very blockhead, and that he remembers almoſt all the things which are done and ſaid, yet cannot tell from what cauſe they did proceed, but only remembers the things. Nor will that which the Doctor ſaies, <hi>Quippe ſine memoria, nulla fit experientia,</hi> mend the matter: for as I do deny any Art or Science can proceed from the ſenſe, memory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; ſo do I not affirm that without the memory, any Art or Science can be made. I ſay no Art nor Science can ariſe from the apprehenſion of ſingulars into the ſenſe, and retaining of them there, and from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment only. For Arts, and Sciences, are not things meerly apprehended, and received into the ſenſe, and ſo retained in memory, but ſomething elſe which is truly and rightly derived from thoſe things, which are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true, and never before known to the ſenſes, or remembred.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And as all the particular ſtories and things in the world retained <note place="margin">Nor from the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without the memory and ſenſes</note> in the memory, cannot move one ſtep to the attaining of any Art or Science; ſo cannot the apprehenſion of univerſal cauſes in the underſtanding, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves produce any thing in order to the attaining of any Art or Science. For univerſal cauſes in nature prove nothing; but as meeting particular cauſes, do determine thoſe, and ſpecifie their Acts. The truth of both theſe is eaſily and daily ſeen in Men, who are very dull, and yet of vaſt memories; who remember all things, but can ſcarcely be ever made to diſcourſe of, and underſtand any thing; and of Men that are too light, and phantaſtical, who only talke generally, without applying theſe generals to any particular. The one is like a Ship, which is overladen with Ballaſt, and not having Sailes proportionable, can ſcarcely be made to ſaile with any winde: the other is like a Ship which hath no Ballaſt, and ſo much ſaile, that ſhe is never in any ſteadineſs, but carried hither and thither upon every ſmall puff of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:200520:21"/> winde, the one will upon any diſcourſe or ratiocination, be ſtill abſurdly telling particular ſtories, which he in his defect of underſtanding, ſuppoſes ſhould be the univerſal and prime reaſon of the diſcourſe: whereas the other from the lightneſs of his phantaſie, and defect of memory; never applies his general notion, to any particular thing, and ſo concludes nothing.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Whereas <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the Doctor affirm, <hi>that experiment proceeds</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Axiomes and Principles do not proceed from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> 
                     <hi>from many memories, or memory multiplied, and that</hi> ratio univerſalis, definitiones, &amp;c. <hi>proceed from experiment.</hi> A Man may juſtly deny it, for it is not many things, or multiplied things, which can make <hi>ratio univerſalis;</hi> but <hi>ratio univerſalis, axioma,</hi> &amp;c. is that which does not ſignify many things only, but every thing which is comprehended in the terms; and it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any Man ſhould make experiment of all things, which are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under one general Notion.</p>

                     <hi>to knowledge, and Sophiſters cropping of the inventions of other Men, the ſame things every where (the order only, and words changed, and a few things of ſmall moment added) do confidently challenge for their own; and render Philoſophy, which ought to be certain and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) obſcure, intricate, and confuſed.</hi> It is true, that in all argumentation <hi>a posteriori, viz.</hi> from the effect to endeavor to find out the cauſe, there can be no direction without experiment; and therefore it is a very difficult, if not an impoſſible thing, that any Art, or Science, can be made from any concluſions in Philoſophy which are drawn <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> which at the beſt cannot ariſe to higher then probable, and opinonative, and can never be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and perſpicuous. And though the Doctor from his great parts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in Anatomy, hath probably found out things never before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; yet cannot any of thoſe concluſions ever attain to demonſtrative certain and perſpicuous concluſions: yet it does not hold true in argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>a priori,</hi> that all things are known by experiment; but that infinite things are known and underſtood, which are abſtracted from matter and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, and are eaſily underſtood by any Man without experiment.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Nor is it true univerſally, <hi>that there is no knowledge innate in Man;</hi> for the Laws of Nature are innate and connatural with Man; and <note place="margin">Man is not naturally without all Knowledge.</note> not acquired either by ſenſe, experiment, or any thing elſe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. As I have ſaid before, ſo do I ſay again, that there is no Age that hath not received many things for truths, which the next generation upon <note place="margin">The manner and order of attaining to Knowledge, is a ſubtil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</note> further inquiry, and looking into them, have found to be but veriſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes: and that from things found out, infinite productions will be made as long as the world indures: and as it is not fairplay to carp at anothers opinion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:200520:21"/> and not to ſet down his own, and give a reaſon for it. So will it be meer levity to conteſt with another, if not upon ſuperior Grounds; and he that ſhall conteſt with ſo great a Philoſopher, as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in a thing ſo long received, and uncontroverted, had need take great heed, and have his wits about him, leaſt inſtead of evicting his adverſary, he only acquires the repute of a light and fooliſh Man; But leaſt we ſhould skip ſhort for want of taking our run far enough back, we will begin at the beginning of all things.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. As I am a Chriſtian, and therefore by the Firſt <hi>Chap. Gen.</hi> ought <note place="margin">There is but one firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and that is God.</note> 
                     <hi>to beleeve, that God made Heaven and Earth, Man and all other Creatures;</hi> ſo if I had not received Gods divine revelation of himſelf in the Scriptures, yet ſhould I never have been a Peripatetick, or Ariſtotelian, who held that not only the world, but the ſpecies of all things in it, were from all eternity. For there was either one firſt being, the true, prime, and efficient cauſe of all things elſe, or two, or more firſt beings, or no firſt being, but all things were originally from themſelves: but the two latter are moſt manifeſtly abſurd and contrary to ſenſe and reaſon; for <hi>unitas eſt, ſecundum quam unumquodque eorum, quae ſunt, unum dicitur;</hi> but the firſt is one thing, it is therefore impoſſible there ſhould be two firſts or more; nor is it leſs abſurd to ſuppoſe all things to have been from eternity, and ſo not to have proceeded from one ſuperior being, but had their being from themſelves; for if all things had from all eternity a power and being of themſelves, then might they have infinitely continued their being in their individuals; and we ſee that every thing does naturally deſire the preſervation of its ſelf; but this is moſt manifeſtly falſe, for we ſee all things are in their individuals reſoluble into their firſt compoſition, and perpetuated by generation in their ſpecies; there is therefore but one firſt being of all things (except ſin, which is contrary to the nature and eſſence of God, who is all good) which is God.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. All things were either originally generated of their like, or from themſelves, or created by God. But nothing could generate any thing like <note place="margin">God in the beginning created all things.</note> it ſelf before it was; and by the precedent propoſition, no Creature could have its original being from its ſelf. All things therefore in the beginning were created by God, and are his Creatures.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. It is true, that the Scriptures do not obſerve an exact method in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Man was created in his perfection, and an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, and rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture actually.</note> all actions according as they were done in time; but it is very probable that <hi>Adam</hi> at his firſt Creation gave names to all Creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 20. But whether it were at <hi>Adams</hi> firſt Creation or not, yet could not <hi>Adams</hi> ſpeech and defining all Gods Creatures, be from any acquired habit, becauſe there was no Creature with whom he might converſe and beget this habit, <hi>(Eve</hi> not being then made) nor did <hi>Adam</hi> only give names to Creatures, but did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe Rationally, and give the Etymology of Woman, when he firſt ſaw her. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23. 24.</note> Man therefore was created an intelligible and Rational Creature, actually.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Although Man were created a moſt perfect, Rational, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible <note place="margin">Man of all creatures is born the moſt impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> Creature; yet we ſee, that he is not only born actually void of underſtanding and reaſon; but alſo the moſt impotent of all Creatures. For all viviparal Creatures (although born blind privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) yet in their very firſt production find a way to their dams papps from whence they ſuck and receive nouriſhment; whereas Man of a long time after his birth (ſo long time, that many other Creatures in leſs time attain to their perfection) is unable to receive any nouriſhment, but as he is directed by others. And all oviparal Creatures without any help,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:200520:22"/> receive that food which their Parents bring them; and all Creatures which are generated <hi>per metamorphoſin,</hi> are at their firſt being as perfect as ever after.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. I underſtand by <hi>Animalia perfectiora,</hi> or more perfect Creatures, <note place="margin">Wherein Man and other more perfect creatures do reſemble one another.</note> thoſe who are generated and produced from univocal generation or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, that is, from the coition of male and female of the ſame ſpecies. Man, and all more perfect creatures, are born with all the five ſenſes of Hearing, Seeing, Smelling, Taſting, and Feeling; and alſo with Will, Memory, and Phantaſie. And though by reaſon of Creatures natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, at their firſt production, theſe three latter are not ſo perſpicuous, as to be perceived by them who do not carefully mind them; yet it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough to thoſe, who more narrowly obſerve them: For there is no Creature, at their very firſt production, which either of themſelves, or apted and diſpoſed to receive food, but do receive it, (if it hath no natural defect or ſickneſs) which it could not do without Will: And all Creatures know, and can diſtinguiſh the lowing, bleating, barking, and voice &amp;c. of their Dams, or thoſe that feed them, from others of the ſame kind; which could not be without Memory: And not only Children in their cradles will (excited by others) laugh and be pleaſant, but alſo of themſelves will many times expreſs much pleaſure in their faces; but alſo Lambs, Colts, Calves, &amp;c. will be playing with one another, all which no doubt proceeds from ſome pleaſure which they fancie. They have moreover at their firſt being, the paſſions of Love, Fear, Hate, &amp;c. which is ſo evidently ſeen in all Creatures, that there needs no example. And truly I think it very probable, that it is from Fear, that every Child cries, upon his being born, apprehending danger from thoſe various new things it never ſaw before.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Although other Creatures have in their firſt being, as well as <note place="margin">Wherein Man is different from other creatures, and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</note> Man, all thoſe Senſes that Man hath, and have moreover Will, Phantaſie, and Memory; yet are their actions determined by their objects, when they are not overruled by fear; nor in proceſs of time do they ever attain to be intelligible or rational Creatures. It is worth the obſervation, that while Man does in ſome ſort attain to ſpeech, underſtanding, and reaſon, he can either not go, or elſe goes upon his hands and feet, with his face prone to the earth, as if there were no difference between him and other Creatures; whereas when he but begins to ſpeak, and can in any ſort obſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his Parents, he then begins to look up to Heaven as a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Creature, and that from thence he expects beatitude, and is to be thankful therefore. And though other Creatures have Phantaſie as well as Men, yet cannot they phancie any object from their Senſes ſo intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as to define it to be ſuch a thing in all the parts of it, excluding every thing elſe. Nor can they by the help of their Memory and Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, ever draw one Concluſion from any thing they ever ſaw, and phancied.</p>

Thus we ſee all irrational Creatures may be taught and habituated to thoſe things which naturally they have no appetite unto, nor moved by any outward object: As Horſes are ridden, and learned to amble, whereas naturally all four-footed Creatures trot; yet have they naturally no appetite thereunto, nor moved by any outward object, but on the contrary are averſe from them.</p>

Creatures void of Underſtanding and Reaſon, have theſe two <note place="margin">Irrational Creatures have Election in their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Paſſions to inform their Will, <hi>viz. appetitus &amp; timor;</hi> and that they take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from both theſe, is evident to any man; for there is no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that purſues any Appetition, but apprehending danger forbears it. It is obſerved of the Fox, that whenſoever hunted to ground, he never comes out, but at the mouth of the Burrow, he lies and vents a while, and afterwards for ſome ſpace, runs directly into the wind; and if he vents any thing which cauſes fear, returns to ground again. Having been much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to hunt the Fox, I have obſerved that many times, when the Fox hath been hunted to ground, and watched to be taken, he hath not come out further then the mouth of the Burrow, if he vented the watcher, (who therefore lies down the wind,) and hath continued ſometime five or ſix nights in the ground, until he hath been almoſt ſtarved; whereas at no time, if he were not watched, but he came out that night. And after they were taken, they would not of a long time eat in ſight of any man, how hungry ſoever, until they became ſo habituated to men, that they apprehended no danger from them. So Deer do naturally deſire to eat Apples, but if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, they vent them to have been handled by man, they forſake them, and flee away affrighted: And ſo all other Creatures, upon apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of danger, ceaſe to purſue their appetite. Thus we ſee in Creatures irrational among themſelves, when they rage moſt in their luſt and appetite, yet give way to them by whom they are overcome. And from hence it is, I conceive, that irrational Creatures are not onely reclaimed from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fierceneſs, but are taught to do thoſe things which they have no appetite or natural inclination to, by cunningly inſinuating danger to them upon their not doing them; and that this muſt be done by inſinuation and cunning, and not by outward force onely, is evident; for the moſt furious and robuſt man is not the beſt horſe-breaker and pacer.</p>

For though I do aſſent to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that all puniſhment for diſobeying or tranſgreſſing Laws, and Exhortation there unto, were vain and ridiculous, if it were not in our power to do them; yet is it not the doing, or not doing of things commanded or forbidden by them who have a right to command or forbid them, a Virtue; but the doing or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:200520:24"/> not doing them in ſuch a formality as they are ſo commanded or forbidden, which makes them virtues; which muſt needs proceed from a higher cauſe then is in man, or can be taught him. As if a Prince commands another to do ſomething which he ought to do, he does it; but takes a reward or bribe from another to do it: I ſay, this is not virtue in the Agent, becauſe he did it not as commanded, but bribed: Whereas another does his duty without reward, and it may be to his much temporal detriment; this is virtue, and muſt needs be from ſome higher cauſe, then is to be found ordinarily in men.</p>

As if I ſee ſuch a ſolid body, the Underſtanding judgeth whether this body be commenſurable or not, by any notion or propoſition before underſtood: This body afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the Idea or form retained in the Memory, the Underſtanding diſcerns and judges the paſſions of it ſo retained, which before it did in the outward ſenſes. So I hear ſuch a ſtory told of things before done; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſound is paſt, and the ſtory retained in the Memory; the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there judges and phancies it. Only things corporeal and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial therefore being the objects of the outward Senſe, and things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal and without ſubſtance the objects of the Underſtanding, there can nothing be in the Underſtanding, which was firſt in the Senſes. It is therefore abſurd for any man to ſay, he underſtands that ſuch a man hath ſuch a hand, or face, or did ſuch an action; becauſe being corporeal and the objects of the Senſe, they cannot be in the Underſtanding, but Memory. He therefore remembers ſuch a man had ſuch a face, or hand, or did ſuch an action. But he may moſt properly ſay, he underſtands ſuch a face, or hand, to be good or handſom; or that ſuch an action was good or bad: becauſe theſe things being incorporeal, cannot be apprehended by the outward Senſes, but judged or phancied to be ſo by the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>

All things therefore are ſo far from being in the ſenſes, before they were in the underſtanding, that it is not only impoſſible that any thing which was in the ſenſe, ſhould be in the underſtanding; but alſo that which is in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, muſt be, before it can judge, diſcern, or phancie any thing, in the memory or ſenſes: And by conſequence, no Art nor Science can be learned or taught another, who does not firſt underſtand the Principles thereof; nor is it poſſible that the Principles of any Art or Science can

                  <p n="2">II.

                  <p n="3">III.

I require Humane and Deſpotical Laws for Principles, to thoſe who by right or due are ſubject to them.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. But God having made Man not only intellectual, rational, and ſociable, but endued him with an immortal ſoul capable of eternal happineſs, He hath extraordinarily and ſupernaturally revealed himſelf in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that men ſubmitting themſelves and their Reaſons to thoſe Divine precepts, might <hi>work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> But if it be asked, How ſhall I know the Scriptures to be Gods Word, ſince they are not known to be ſo by the underſtanding, nor outward ſenſe? I would ask that man, if he be a Chriſtian, how he came to be ſo? For his being a Chriſtian, implies his belief in them as the Word of God; and he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no more: And if the power and grace of God were not as much ſhewed in converting the world to Chriſtianity by the preaching of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poor Fiſhermen (all Temporal powers perſecuting and contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it) as in all the Miracles of old under the Prophets and Patriarchs? And whether the power and grace of God in his Son, was not more viſible under the New, then in the Prophets, and under the Old Law?</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the Laws or Precepts of God in the Scripture command
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:200520:26"/> many things <hi>in Theſi</hi> only, (as, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order;</hi>

                  <p>I require only Humane, Eccleſiaſtical and Deſpotical Laws for principles, which do not immediately proceed from God. All other principles what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever proceed, or are immediately created only by God alone.</p>

But by the 37. Propoſition; there is nothing in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which was in the ſenſes. Mens Obedience therefore, or their obligation in conſcience to the Laws of their ſuperiors, is not from any thing which was in the ſenſes, But it does proceed from the connatural Laws of Nature, engraven by God in the minds or underſtandings of Men, or from his Grace ſupernaturally given to Men; and by conſequence, thoſe men who do not from innate good principles, their duty in conſcience, will never from any thing feared or received into the ſenſes, be it Whipping, Branding, or Hanging, ever be made good, but only deterred from being bad.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. Belief is the aſſenting to a thing to be true or falſe, not as either <note place="margin">What is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</note> known to the underſtanding or outward ſenſes, but as affirmed or denied by one or more, who are credible perſons.</p>

                  <p n="45">45. It is an admirable thing to conſider the providence of God (who <note place="margin">Whether things only credible, may be as certain as known to the ſenſes, and incident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of truth above any ſenſible knowledge.</note> is the God of truth) in the preſervation of thoſe things, which impartially relate the actions of Men, and the revolutions which have hapned in the world. Nor is it any more then a juſt and equal teſtimony <hi>Polybius</hi> in the Proem of his Hiſtory gives of Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhe ought to be eſteemed as the greateſt goddeſs; and that the greateſt power ought to be aſcribed to her, overcoming and triumphing over all the oppoſitions of Men, and veriſimilitudes. Nor can any reaſon be given that <hi>Polybius, Livy, Plutarch,</hi> &amp;c. did either write ſuch Hiſtories, or that ſuch Hiſtories written by them, were truer then thoſe which are loſt and rejected by Men, but only a kind of divine ayre informing Men of their truth; whereas thoſe books which are falſely and factiouſly written, are exploded and neglected in a very ſhort time; and yet whether they were truly or falſely written, few or no Men can judge from any thing known to the outward ſence. I ſay few or no Man can ſo judge of them; for in that time when they were written, there were many more falſe and factious Hiſtorians to delude Men, then true and juſt to inform them. Nor can Men in ſubſequent generations from any thing in their outward ſences, judge or diſcern whether any thing they record be true or falſe. Nay further, no Hiſtorian (except <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and ſome very few others, who recorded infinitely more things not known, then known to them to be true) did ever know whether what he recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded were true or not. To evidence this yet more fully, there was ſcarcely (except <hi>Caeſars</hi> &amp; <hi>Xenophons)</hi> ever any Hiſtory truly written in thoſe times, wherein the things were done, that men might take information from their outward ſenſes; but Men were ſo carried by Faction or Intereſt, that in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:200520:26"/> recording of things, they record things not as true or falſe, but as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their Faction and Intereſt: whereas Men in the ſubſequent generation not having thoſe Paſſions and Appetitions, nor any ſenſe of theſe things; ſubjecting all their Paſſions and Affections, as it were aſſiſted by a divine Election, do make Election of thoſe things which are true, and reject others, which the Malice or Faction of Men had impoſed upon the World. And a Man is as certain, that there have been ſuch Men as <hi>Caeſar, Hanibal, Alexander, &amp;c.</hi> and as aſſured of their Actions, as if he had ſeen them.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. Since all things which proceed from God immediately, and for <note place="margin">Faith is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gift of God.</note> which no reaſon can be given by any Creature, may be juſtly required for principles by intellectual and reaſonable Creatures; and ſince the Scriptures proceed immediately from God, or they could not be the Word of God, are therefore the principles of Faith. And ſince there is nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man naturally, which may aſſure him, that thoſe things revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were Gods <hi>Revelation;</hi> it does neceſſarily follow, That Faith, or the Belief of God in the Scriptures, is Gods gift ſupernaturally and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily. Nor can all the Arguments of Tradition, Church, Excellency of ſtile, Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> move one ſtone to the proof of them: For they were the Word of God, before any Church or Tradition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was. And if they had not been the Word of God before the Church received them, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to poſterity; their Reception and Tradition could never have made them ſo. Beſides, the Church having its being from the Scriptures, it can never prove the cauſe of its being. And what was it leſs, then the power and grace of God extraordinarily given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> That the Buſh burned and was not conſumed? And of all the miracles done by him, and the other Prophets; and more then thoſe, done by our Saviour, and the Apoſtles, and bleſſed Martyrs ſince? And that by the Preaching of a few Fiſhermen, againſt all the Temporal Powers in the World, Chriſtianity ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated generally over the face of the Earth; and that I without any thing in me, or deſert of mine, am baptiſed into this Faith? And he that ſhall diſpute the truth of the grace and power of God in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and ſince recorded in Eccleſiaſtical and Prophane Hiſtory, ought as much to be confuted with clubs and hiſſing, as he that denies or diſputes his Principles in any Art or Science.</p>

As the Laws of Nature, and Gods revealing himſelf in the Scriptures, are principles, neceſſary, and immutable by all the Men in the World; yet are they not principles, neceſſary, or immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by God; but he might, if it had pleaſed him, made ſomething elſe the Law of Nature, or otherwiſe revealed himſelf in the Scriptures. So Humane Laws muſt be prime, neceſſary, and immutable by Subjects, or their conforming, or not conforming their actions to them, could not be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:200520:27"/> juſt or unjuſt: But they cannot be prime, and neceſſary, or immutable by the Legiſlator, but as he ſees occaſion may alter or make ſomething elſe which was not before Laws for the Subjects to conform and direct their actions to. It is therefore abſurd and wilde to ſuppoſe, that the Law of Nature is <note place="margin">Annotat.</note> ſimply neceſſary and immutable by God, or that the will of Men can make it mutable.</p>

                  <p n="62">62. It is truly obſerved, that every perfect creature is generated from <note place="margin">Rational Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by the reaſon and memory, or outward ſenſes.</note> matter and form, diffuſed in ſeveral bodies and creatures; and that this matter and form, ſo long as it continues, thus diffuſed in divers bodies, is never qualified for generation or production of any creature, until they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come united into ſome place apted and diſpoſed for production, where from the benign influence of the Sun or celeſtial bodies, as from a more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and efficient cauſe, they evade into living creatures. Nor does this hold leſs true in the production or generation of all rational Science; for the Reaſon by it ſelf without matter, cannot form, diſpoſe, or define any thing. Nor does the outward ſenſe or memory apprehend things otherwiſe then as ſeen, &amp;c. or remembred, not as formed, diſpoſed, or defined, ſo as to be the ſubject of a Propoſition. Since therefore the Reaſon cannot prepare, apt, or define, unleſs the Memory or outward ſenſes ſupply matter; nor the Memory without the Reaſon diſpoſe, prepare, or define any thing ſo as to be the ſubject of a Propoſition; it does neceſſarily follow, that the Reaſon united or conjoined with the Memory, does prepare the ſubject of every Scientifical Propoſition. But in every Scientifical Propoſition, there muſt be a Predicate, which comprehending the Subject, muſt be underſtood. The Underſtanding therefore is the prime and efficient cauſe of all rational Science; and the Reaſon is the formal cauſe, which does diſpoſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the matter in the Senſes or Memory to be comprehended, judged, or diſcerned by the Underſtanding: And by conſequence, the Reaſon and Memory, or Senſes, are but the Inſtruments by which the Underſtanding does generate and produce Science.</p>

Only Man can rightly infer and deduce particular Concluſions <note place="margin">Why only Man is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> from univerſal Cauſes, and can direct his actions conformable to things in his underſtanding, (and not to his appetite and ſenſes, which is common to all living creatures as well as man:) only Man therefore is a rational creature.</p>

All men naturally deſire to know: And though by <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">By what means men attain to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> all Science is begotten from preexiſtent Knowledge, which from things granted does demonſtrate the Concluſions; yet muſt there be ſome manner and method which men muſt uſe, by which others as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may underſtand this, or that thing to be a Science, or ſcientifical
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:200520:28"/> Concluſion. Men therfore muſt propoſe that method which <hi>Euclid</hi> obſerves, or all their ſcience will be equivocal and obſcure, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt to define all thoſe things of which his ſcience is compounded, in ſuch terms, that every ſingular or individual may be ſo comprehended, that it may be wholly with all the parts of it contained in the definition, excluding every thing elſe: For if a man define a thing ſo, that there be any ſo much as equivocation in it, as that it does not ſignifie this only thus deſined, but may ſomething elſe; then of neceſſity muſt all the Science that bears a part of this definition, be equivocal and uncertain. And as the definition muſt not be equivocal to ſignifie more then the thing defined, another thing as well as this; ſo neither muſt it ſignifie leſs, <hi>viz.</hi> any part of the thing defined, for the thing; for then all in which this thing is a part, will be infinitely deficient and imperfect.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, After the definitions, I require ſuch things as no ingenuous man will deny: As, that I may adde, divide, multiply, convert, &amp;c. theſe things thus defined.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſet down thoſe Axioms, Principles, <hi>Effata, Pronuntiata,</hi> Common Notions, or Indemonſtrable Propoſitions, which are the firſt cauſes of the Science, and do demonſtrate all the Concluſions of it; but in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are indemonſtrable, and for which no reaſon can be given, but only the good will and pleaſure of him that made them ſo. And theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples muſt be granted, before any man can by his Reaſon produce any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. And if a man denies theſe Principles, all Argumentation is at an end; for, <hi>Contra negantem principia non eſt diſputandum:</hi> And no mans Reaſon can work upon nothing; nor prove, nor find out any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſomething be firſt granted, by which a man may prove it, or find it out.</p>

I have known, and know many men, who have vaſt memories, <note place="margin">Why ſome men are more phantaſtical then others.</note> and very ſtrong phantaſies, who notwithſtanding have been as unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as any; and would never admit of any diſcourſe of any thing they fancied to themſelves, but upon a very ſlender oppoſition would fall into paſſion: And the reaſon is, becauſe they phancie things only becauſe they pleaſe them, and do not underſtand them as true. And if any man ſhews ſuch a man ſome Conſequence which will not follow from what he phancies, or that it is inconſiſtible with ſome known univerſal Truth; then does he ſeek to ſupply with paſſion what he wants in reaſon, becauſe he is croſſed in what he deſires ſhould be true. Whereas men who underſtand, or deſire to underſtand their <hi>Theſis</hi> or Notion, not only take pleaſure that nothing can be inferred from it which is falſe, and that it is not inconſiſtible with any thing true whatſoever; but will be ſo far from falling into paſſion with any man that oppoſes it, that they would thank any man, and take him for their friend, that can ſhew them wherein, what they ſuppoſe to be univerſally true, is not; or that it is inconſiſtible with ſomething which they ſuppoſe to be univerſally true. The Spirit of God ſays, <hi>He is a fool that rages and is confident.</hi> Theſe light phantaſtical men, who will phancie things for truth, not becauſe they are ſo, but becauſe they would have them ſo, do not only rage when they are convinced that thoſe things they phancie for truth, are made to appear either but veriſimilitudes, or falſhoods; but will take them for illwillers who convince them, and continue as confident in their fooliſh apprehenſions, as before.</p>

As the levity of the Phantaſie (which is always in agitation) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending <note place="margin">Why ſome men are more dull then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> things without Reaſon, is the cauſe why men too ſuddenly apprehend Veriſimilitudes for Truth; ſo the want of Phantaſie is the cauſe why many men of vaſt memories, very ſlowly apprehend the cauſe of any thing. Where the Phantaſie is too light, there men apprehend or believe every thing for Truth, they affect or deſire, and are ſoon perſwaded to any thing they are not wilfully prejudiced to.

In the firſt God is the great and only Opificer: And it is only He who made Man and all other Creatures (not meerly ſpiritual) of ſuch principles, and ſo compounded, that they every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute tend to the reſolution of their firſt principles; and yet in their thus dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſomething ſhould generate in them, which ſhould perpetuate the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in their ſpecies, as they ſhall dye in their individuals. Thus we ſee ſome ſoyl brings forth (without any art or induſtry of man) Graſs, Firr, Broom, &amp;c. Some is of a petrifying quality; in other are Mines of Silver, Gold, Coal, &amp;c. <hi>&amp; non omnis fert omnia tellus.</hi> Some men grow ſick, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers well, without any cauſe from themſelves: Theſe cauſes therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only known to God, there cannot be any demonſtrative concluſion from them by men, becauſe the cauſes are not evidently and neceſſarily known. But although it be not Gods pleaſure that men ſhould underſtand the cauſes of theſe things, ſo as to conclude demonſtratively from them; yet as having made two lights of different ſplendor, <hi>vix.</hi> the Sun and Moon, though men ſee clearly only by the light of the Sun, yet do men ſee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though obſcurely and but probably, by the light of the Moon; ſo though men do not in natural Philoſophy and Phyſick from prime and neceſſary cauſes, as from the light of the Sun, ſee ſo as to conclude demonſtratively; yet hath not God always in theſe things totally ſhut out all light from men, but they ſee as by the light of the Moon; and in Philoſophy are Theſes, and Aphoriſms in Phyſick, from whence by theſe ſenſes, memory and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, men proceed infinitely, and daily probably finde out things, which before were not ſo.</p>

                        <label>Author.</label> Our Author concludes this Paragraph, <hi>That the Nature of Man is to be free; and to act whatever he does, becauſe it ſeems beſt unto him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in the next Paragraph he begins concluding, <hi>That to make Men work freely, is to determine their actions; and concludes, That if Reaſons were ſolid, when the Governor propoſed them, ſuch muſt of neceſsity be for the most part the ſequel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> Thus hath our Author learned new terms of Philoſophy, which neither the Schools, nor <hi>Aristotle</hi> ever heard of, <hi>viz.</hi> Of determining Mens actions to make them work freely, and that neceſſity is but for the moſt part; the contrary of which is true in both, for neceſſity is <hi>ad unum</hi> and determined, and freedom <hi>ad plura.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> Yet theſe are things of no conſideration with our Author; but he goes on confidently, and in the next Paragraph tells us, <hi>Experience maketh this ſame as manifeſt as Reaſon concludeth it;</hi> and then tells us <hi>of a Mother and Nurſe, and of a Sucking Childe, and gay things,</hi> and I know not what indeed, and nothing to the purpoſe; and at laſt concludes, <hi>That the perfection of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agreed on by all hands, is to make the obeyer underſtand, that it is his own profit the action aims at.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> Why, and I tell our Author, That to make the obeyer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that it is his own profit which the action aims it, is the next way to ruine this, or any other action which any Governor undertakes for the good either of himſelf, or the obeyer: For, Secrecy (the life of all actions and deſigns, a quality wherein Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> was ſo eminent) cannot be, if the obeyer muſt be made to underſtand that it is for his good. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for Performance, cannot expect a return of the Subjects underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether ſuch a thing conduces to their good or no: Beſides, it is a madneſs for any man to go about to make another man underſtand, what is not poſſible for him to do. Now Reaſons and Myſteries of State ſo far tranſcend the capacities of Subjects in general, that it is impoſſible for them to underſtand them; and one of the chief ends of all Government is, To ſuppreſs Faction, and retain the governed in their Obedience. And the endeavoring to make the governed to underſtand, whether this or that be better for them, will probably divide them into Factions, about this and that (for Reaſon, God knows, but little will be found amongſt them) to the danger and deſtruction of one another. It is ſufficient for the obeyer to underſtand, that his Safety and Preſervation depends upon his Obedience, and that his ruine follows from his diſobedience: And what General of an Army (who hath but a ſubordinate power) who commands a party upon a deſign, though to the peril of their lives, will expect a return from that party, That they do not underſtand that this deſign is for their good? With more Reaſon ought a Supream Prince to expect obedience from his Subjects to his commands: Rightly therefore ſays <hi>Seneca, Nil mihi frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius videtur, quam lex cum prologo, Jubeat enim non ſuadeat lex.</hi> And <hi>Cicero, Cum legem dico, nihil a me intelligi volo quam imperium, ſine quo, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> IT is true, That all Power in Government whatſoever, which is not Legal or Eccleſiaſtical, is Natural; yet no Government or exerciſe of Power whatſover is Natural, but Rational, Politick and Voluntary. Our Author therefore, who goes about to make all Power in Government, Politick and Voluntary, and Government to be Natural, is like to have a great task of it. Well therefore may he be loſt in a wood, and cry out, It is impoſſible for him to finde the way out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is like a blinde man, who becauſe he is ſo, would perſwade another that no body ſees; or like a man that hath loſt his way, ſays, There is no ſuch thing as the high Road: Sure he thinks no man can ſee but with our Authors eyes, or that it was ſaid to him, as to <hi>Eſdras, Accendam in corde tuo lucernam intellectus:</hi> Why, if he had learned his Leſſon a little further in his Maſter <hi>Xenophon,</hi> he would have told him, That to govern Men, was neither to be put into the number of thoſe things which could not be done, nor to be eſteemed hard to be done, if a man knowingly handle it.</p>

And how can he be Prince, who muſt be ſubject and ſubordinate to all?</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> Our Author goes on and tells us, <hi>Nevertheleſs Nature does not recede wholly from her Principle, in thus ſubjecting one mans understanding to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others, and the greater moſt times to the leſſer; for it does not this otherwiſe, then by making the party ſubjected, ſee, it is his own good to truſt anothers skill.</hi>

And then takes leave both of the Laws and limits of it, and ſaies it is plain, that the immediate end is, that our works &amp; all that concerns us may be well done, even to thoſe things wherein our ſelves have no skill, or not enough; and the more remote end to be atcheived by this, is, that our life may be good and happy, and the end of Nature arived at by us. So here are three ends, and all plain, <hi>viz.</hi> the Immediate end, the more Remote end, and the end of Nature; but where the eaſie to-be-underſtood Laws and limits of Obedience are, or which of the three ends is the plain and immediate end of it, (and yet we our ſelves to have no skill in thoſe things it concerns) is ſure an eaſie to be underſtood, plain, and immediate end only to our Author, and no ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or intellectual creature beſide.</p>
                     <p>What would our Author have? I cannot tell. Now becauſe aſwell in <hi>Theologie</hi> as in <hi>Geometry, Phyſick, Philoſophy,</hi> and in all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> whatſoever, there muſt be <hi>quaedam postulata,</hi> ſome Axiomes and Principles given, which muſt be ſo plain and perſpicuous, that no exception can be taken againſt them, and theſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>Indemonſtrable Propoſitions;</hi> for if there be any ſo much as <hi>equivocation</hi> in any of them, the Concluſions and Inferences from them muſt be infinitely more uncertain; And becauſe that <hi>Definitio est excluſio aequivoci,</hi> before we proceed, let us define what obedience is: <hi>Obedience then is the conformation of ones will to the rules &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of his ſuperior:</hi> As when a Creature conforms his will to the rules and precepts of God; or when a ſubject conforms his will to the Law of his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign;</hi> or when a Son conformes his will to his Fathers Commands: This is Obedience, and he that does not obey, ſins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> Well our Author goes on and tells us, <hi>The Conditions are three.</hi>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> Why, he tells you in the precedent Ground, <hi>That I muſt truſt my Lawyer and my Phyſitian, though I be neither.</hi>

                     <p> 
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, but I am not bound to this Lawyer, or that Phyſitian; but in caſe of ſubjection, I am bound only to my Prince: Nor do I ſin, if I follow not the advice of either; which I do, in not obeying my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> Thirdly, <hi>That he be an Honorable perſon in whom we deal.</hi> 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> Our Author, no doubt, is a wiſe Fellow, and likely hopes that he or his Patron may be this Honorable perſon, when this Fuſtian ſhall be acted. Now here let any man ſee, (if any thing may be collected out of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical nonſenſe, or what follows hereon in the two next ſubſequent pages) whether our Author does not make Obedience to conſiſt on the Obligors part, in conformity to a delegate and ſubordinate power of their own making: As if I give my Servant power to receive my Rents, or my Bailiff power to overſee and order my grounds, which my Servant and Bailiff do, that then I obey my Servant and Bailiff. Well therefore may our Author ſay, that it is a fallacious principle, to maintain <hi>Obedience to be a principal vertue,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 22.</note> ſince he underſtands no better: Why then I will tell our Author, that, at worſt, 'tis better then the <hi>Sacrifice of Fools,</hi> and therefore better then any thing he can ſay or do without it.</p>
                     <p>But how mean a thing ſoever he makes Obedience here, yet he rarely keeps long in a mind to any thing; for, <hi>pag.</hi> 98. he ſays, <hi>We know, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ground</hi> 12.</note> 
                        <hi>how excellent a vertue this act of Obedience is; having a motive of ſo great a price and high elevation above other ordinary employments, which reach no farther then to his private good.</hi> And then moſt ſenſeleſly he confounds the offices of Command and Obedience; and as abſurdly prefers the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Commander, becauſe it is not commanded or limited, before the idiotical good of the Subject: obſerving the ſame method in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as he does in his Laws; ſometimes they are the Peoples Laws, which reſtrain their Supreme Truſtee, or Governor; otherwhile they are the Truſtees Laws, who may with our Authors licence at other times do what he liſt. Such plain, certain, and eaſie to be underſtood things, are our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Laws and Obedience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> But oh, our Authors Will is ſuch a thing, (as you know who rage and are moſt confident) that by no means he will part with it: 'Tis all a caſe to him, whether there be a King, or no King in Iſrael; for he will do what is right in his own eyes. For our Author ſays, <hi>In renouncing the power</hi>

                        <hi>of our Will, we renounce our Underſtanding alſo.</hi> Our Author for his part needs not fear it; but ſure he fears that if he do ſo, (becauſe he cannot hope that he is qualified enough to be a Privy-Councellor) that he has bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up from dabling with the <hi>Grounds of Obedience and Government.</hi> Why, he ſhould do well to be of Counſel with <hi>Adam</hi> againſt God, for the Devil and he agree in the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not liberty enough for <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of the other trees of the garden in Eden; no, <hi>Adam</hi> muſt not renounce his will and underſtanding too, in order to his chiefeſt good (the knowledge of good and evil) and making himſelf like unto God, by taſting the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit: To our Author it is not liberty enough, for the Subject to ſquare his actions to the Laws and Rules of his Country; he muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his will, to be commanded by King or Laws, but muſt have his will too in making of Laws. Now let our Author tell me, what a Government this is like to prove: Who will hold the plough, that is perſwaded he may handle the ſcepter? Who will live in an obſcure cottage, that hopes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:200520:36"/> he may govern at the helm? or eat his bread in the ſweat of his brows, who may expect to fare deliciouſly every day? And now let me tell our Author once for all, That humane Laws are made to retain Subjects in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, leſt a worſe thing happen unto them. There muſt be no ſtarting out, or breaking looſe from them: For, Laws are like the banks which encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs waters; if there be the leaſt hole in them, the banks will be blown up, and the waters loſe themſelves.</p>

                        <label>Obſerv.</label> Well: But ſince the men of this world were never more unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and every man ſo pretending to Reaſon, and yet no man almoſt can
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:200520:36"/> tell what he means by Reaſon, let us ſee what <hi>Ratio,</hi> Reaſon is; and what Reaſoning is; and why Man is onely ſaid to be a reaſonable creature. Reaſon is properly that power of the ſoul, by which a Man is diſcerned from other living creatures, and by which he does excell and command them: By <hi>Horace</hi> it is put for the reaſoning and diſcourſing of the ſoul, for finding out what is true; <hi>Ratio ponitur pro ratiocinatione &amp; diſcurſu animi, ad inveſtigandum verum. Cicero lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Heren. Ratio eſt cauſa quae demonſtrat verum eſſe id, quod intendimus brevi ſubjectione;</hi> Reaſon is the cauſe which ſhews that thing to be true, which we intend in a ſhort view: And Reaſon is many times equivocally uſed for Counſel, as <hi>Cicero in Verr. Mea quidem ratio, cum in praeteritis rebus eſt cognita, tum in reliquis explorata &amp; proviſa eſt;</hi> My counſel is as well known in things paſt, as throughly tried and provided in other things. Sometime for Reſpect; <hi>Habenda eſt ratio honoris,</hi> Men ought to reſpect their honor. Sometime for Care; <hi>Habenda eſt ratio rei familiaris,</hi> Men muſt look after their houſhold-affairs. Sometime for Buſineſs; <hi>Rationem habet cum terra, quae nunquam recuſat imperium,</hi> He buſieth himſelf with his land which never diſobeys him. Thus far <hi>Calapine.</hi> Sometime it is taken for Account, <hi>Lu.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>Redde rationem villicationis tuae,</hi> Give an account of thy Stewardſhip. <hi>Ratio,</hi> in the third Definition of the fifth Book of <hi>Euclide, eſt duarum magnitudinum ejuſdem generis, mutua quaedam ſecundum quantitatem, habitudo:</hi> Reaſon is a certain mutual habit, of two magnitudes of the ſame kind after their quantity: As when two Quantities of the ſame kind, two Numbers, two Lines, two Superficies, two Solids, &amp;c. are compared one to another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their quantity, that is, accordingly as one is greater, leſs, or equal to another; this compariſon or mutual habit of one to another, was by Geometricians called <hi>Ratio.</hi> But now, I know not by what habit or cuſtom, <hi>Proportio,</hi> (which definition 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                        <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Euclid.</hi> is, <hi>Rationum ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo;</hi> And definition 5, conſiſts in three terms at leaſt, for indeed it muſt conſiſt in four; for where it is in three, the <hi>medium</hi> is iterated twice, as what proportion four hath to ſix, ſix hath to nine, &amp;c.) hath eaten the former quite up, and is only uſed.</p>
                     <p>Or take Reaſon thus: Reaſon is that by which men from given Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, do rightly infer and deduce Concluſions. And Reaſoning is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either <hi>à priori,</hi> or <hi>à poſteriori: A priori,</hi> from the cauſe, nature, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of neceſſary truths, to ſhew what effects follow from thence; and ſuch Propoſitions are called demonſtrative or ſcientifical, ſhewn and known from the Cauſes; ſuch are all Propoſitions in Geometry and Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques: Or when the Effect is certain, and the Cauſe probable; and theſe are but probable Concluſions, ſuch as thoſe in Philoſophy and Phyſick. As I would know the reaſon why Summer is hotter then Winter, for ſo I find it to be; why, thus I reaſon: It cannot be from the propinquity of the Sun to the Earth, in Summer more then in Winter, for the Earth is but a Point in proportion to the Univerſe; beſides, the Sun is nearer to the Earth in Winter then in Summer, for the <hi>Orbis magnus</hi> is not Spherical or Circular, but Eccentrical and Elliptical, which is plain, becauſe the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Earth, or the Suns motion, is finiſhed in leſs time from the Autumnal Equinox to the Vernal, then from the Vernal to the Autumnal, and therefore nearer to the Earth in Winter then in Summer. It is not then from the Suns nearneſs to the Earth, which makes the Summer hotter
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:200520:37"/> then the Winter; I find, that the higher the Sun riſes in our Horizon, that is, the nearer it comes to our Zenith when at the Meridian, the hotter it is: I therefore probably conclude, that the heat in Summer is cauſed from the reflexion of the Sun; and the nearer the <hi>radii</hi> are reflected to right angles, the hotter it is; and the more obliquely they are reflected, the colder it is. Or as when a Phyſitian from the ſymptoms of his indiſpoſed Patient, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to find out the cauſes of his diſtemper, &amp;c. this is reaſoning <hi>à po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriori,</hi> from the effect to find out the cauſe: And men may reaſon from uncertain and falſe Principles, as well as true, but then always the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo. And therefore all <hi>Clavius</hi> his Demonſtrations in his Practical Geometry, and at the end of the ſixth Book of <hi>Euclid,</hi> of the Quadrature of a Circle, though the Demonſtrations be truly deduced, are uncertain, becauſe it does not certainly appear, That from the imaginary motion of the two right lines he there ſpeaks of, the Quadratrix line does cut the Baſe ſo, that the ſide of the Quadratrix is a mean proportional between the Baſe and the Arch of the Quadrant. And the Inferences and Concluſions which have cauſed ſo much confuſion and diſtraction in theſe times, are drawn from feigned and falſe Principles. But in all true Propoſitions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, no reaſon can be given for the firſt grounds and principles of them, but only the will of the great Creator of all things, who therefore ſo made them, becauſe it ſo ſeemed good unto him.</p>
                     <p>Of all the creatures upon earth, Man only is reaſonable, for Man only contemplates God, and looks up to heaven, as thence expecting his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitude. <hi>Ovid. Metam.—</hi>

Or when did Men ever in the World in any place, either live, or deſire to live ſo? Indeed it is a received opinion, that Man is born a living Creature, apt and fit for ſociety; the Greeks called him <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but indeed no Man does naturally deſire the ſociety, company or converſation of another Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a Man; and therefore Men do not, nor ever did live promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in flocks and multitudes (as our Author ſaies) without ſubordination one under another; but in any the meaneſt and moſt contemptible Family that ever was, the company are not all alike to one another, as thoſe are which live in flocks and herds, &amp;c. But becauſe no Infant can live, nor any Man live well without the help of another, naturally there is in every Man a ſolitude how to live, and ſo to live that his living be not a burden, or troubleſom to him. Man does not therefore deſire the company or ſociety of others as men (for then he would deſire the company and ſociety of all men alike, of Good, of Bad, of Vertuous, of Vicious, of Servants and Vile, as well as Noble and Generous) but accidentally as expecting Profit, Honor, Knowledge, &amp;c. from him or them with whom he conſorts or aſſociates himſelf. And therefore on the Exchange, in Faires, Markets, &amp;c. Men do not Meet ſo as only to ſee one another, and to make up ſuch a Herd, for then they would meet in other places as well as there, but that from their buying and ſelling and their exchanging of Merchandiſe, they may derive from thence profit to themſelves. It is an admirable thing to ſee what a ſtrange Ingenuity there is in thoſe men, in acquiring thoſe things from other places, which Nature (by the ſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, negation, &amp;c. of their own Country, (for <hi>Non omnis fert omnia tellus,)</hi>

                     <p>And men prefer that ſociety wherein they ſuppoſe themſelves honored and eſteemed, before that wherein they think themſelves ſlighted and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; and where Youth and Vigor do abound, there Men ſeek to them who will conſort to them in Hunting, Hawking, Shooting, &amp;c. as they affect this and that for their exerciſe: And vitious Men will endeavor to find out ſuch ſociety as will excite and accompany them in thoſe vices to which they are prone: And becauſe only Ingenious Men Philoſophize, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ingenious Men will not willingly conſort themſelves, but with them from whom they expect either to learn, or to be eſteemed more Ingenious or more learned then any in the company; For naturally every Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that from converſing with another, he may draw more Profit, more Honor, more Pleaſure, more Learning, &amp;c. to himſelf; and when he has ſo done, he is ſo far from being ſatisfied therewith, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to ſolitarineſs how to increaſe what he has got into more, which no other creatures which live in companies doe, but when they have eaten up all in one place, ſeek where they may devoure it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> Our Author is the firſt man that ever I heard of who deſired to hold his Wife in common.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> Our Author afterward tells us, <hi>That the first Origine of Mens meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and living together, is, that Men are moſt burthenſome to themſelves when they are alone, and ſeek company to divert themſelves, ſo to elude the length of time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> So that he who cannot tell what to do, but is a burthen to himſelf, may keep company with our Author ſo to foole away the time. I have ſeen many Chandlers Bills with all <hi>Items</hi> in them, but never ſaw any Section mangled with three <hi>Firſts</hi> altogether, but here in our Author.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> Now our Author is got looſe from his Firſts, and arrived at the next, which is, <hi>That God and Nature have ſo managed mankind, that no one has of himſelf as much as he deſires, but regularly aboundeth in one kind of goods, and wants ſome other which his neighbour has.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> Now, who is he of whom our Author ſpeaks? Why, one of his rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal multitude (as he calls them by and by) before they have choſen a Truſtee; what's here to doe? Why his rational multitude have all things in common one with another, no one abounds in any one thing more then another, but are like ſwine feeding, eating, and promiſcuouſly herding together, or a kennel of Hounds devouring a dead Horſe, who have it all in common, yet no Dog any more right to any piece of the Horſe than another, but as he gets it and eats it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> In the third place comes Fear: <hi>For he that finds himſelf ſtored with thoſe</hi>

                        <hi>things which he and others love, is ſubject to feare thoſe whom he ſuſpects able to bereave him of them, and ſo ſeeks company of friends for protection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> Now would I fain know of our Author, how this Man of his Rational Multitude came by theſe things, he ſo fears to loſe? Why, has not any of his Multitude as much Right to them as he? Sure he muſt have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitiouſly cheated or ſtollen them from the reſt of the Rational Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for I cannot ſee what other Right he can have to them; It may be though it is not too Meaphyſical a nicety for a Moral Treatiſe, and our Author can reſolve you; and let the Reader read on and ſee, how he prefers the paſſion of Love before that of Feare, which he ſaies <hi>agrees both with Philoſophy and Morality,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> Now our Author got within ſight of Land, there's now nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that the Rational Multitude name their <hi>Trustee, who ought rather to be a good and a wiſe Man, then a Foole and Knave,</hi> and our Authors Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is perfect; yet for feare leſt no Man but ſhould underſtand it, in concluſion he tells you, <hi>You ſee Government is naturally a Power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Common Affaires of the Multitude, by a voluntary ſubmiſsion of the Communities wills to their Governors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> Now will I be burnt if ever any Man proclaimed himſelf ſuch a Cockſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb as our Author does all along this ground; In his Three Firſts, then in his holding his Wife in Common, in his Care and Feare for the goods of the Individuals of his Rational multitude, who poſſibly could have none at all, and now by the giving up of theirs to the will of their Governor, which thing <hi>(Ground</hi> 4.) <hi>he cannot ſee how it can be pleaſing to God,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> nay he tells you, <hi>'tis like a Mans mangling himſelf, or</hi> Origens <hi>guelding himſelf, or</hi> Simeon Styletes <hi>chaining himſelf to a Hill, that he might not go thence for Gods ſake:</hi> But it may be our Author has a help at Mawe; for our Author <hi>Ground</hi> 8. ſaies, <hi>It is evident by this Reſignation of the Peoples will, the Magistrate receives ſuch an activity and power, as he has explicated before, did ariſe out of a mans promiſe to his Neighbor.</hi> So then, a Man may mangle himſelf, <hi>Origen</hi> may gueld himſelf, and <hi>Simeon Styletes</hi> may chain himſelf up to a Hill, though not for Gods ſake, yet ſo far as it does ariſe from their promiſe to their Neighbor. </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> But unleſs a Man ſhould affect miſtaking; I think of all men, our Author is moſt accurſed to it; for now he makes his Rational Multitude a people, when they have made their Truſtee or Supreme Governor; whereas, other Men alwaies underſtood by the people, them who had aſſumed the Supreame Power in them; As when a Man ſaies, the People of <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> he meanes them in whom the pretended Supreame Power was, and by the Multitude he means, them in whom the Supreame Power was not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> Now is our weary <hi>Trojan</hi> arrived at his wiſhed ſhore, having ſung his <hi>Paean</hi> and erected a <hi>Trophy,</hi> ſays, <hi>No moderate and diſcreet perſon can doubt, but a Government ſo ordered, is both neceſſary and connatural to a rational mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and in a word, ſuch as Humane nature requires, and is the beſt, if not the onely that ſutes to the diſpoſition of freemen and prudent.</hi>

                        <label>Obſerv.</label> Yet ſure, if after all this glorious boaſt, this Peacock but looks upon his feet, he will let fall his tail; for his <hi>Second Ground</hi> is, <hi>That the nature of Man reacheth not to the perfection of Government:</hi> But what does our Author here mean by <hi>Freemen?</hi> if by Freemen he underſtands men free to do what they liſt, then our Author leaves them as he found them, and has done

                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> What is this our Authors <hi>Abſolute Governor?</hi> Why, the <hi>Roman Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator</hi> was worth ten of this; for he had power of life and death, of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of all Offices at his own will and pleaſure, without the controlment of any either Senate or People, Conſul or Tribune, and this power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue during the exigence and danger of the Commonwealth. Yet ſo far was the <hi>Dictator</hi> from being an abſolute Governor, that he was the while but a Miniſter of the Peoples; which was plain in <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> for <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Plutar. in vita Fabii &amp; Liv. lib.</hi> 22.</note> though he were choſen <hi>Dictator,</hi> yet during the danger of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the People made <hi>Minutius</hi> equal to him. And ſo was the <hi>Athenian Archon,</hi> who though choſen for Ten years and called a Judge, and chiefeſt of power in the Commonwealth, yet as <hi>Bodin</hi> obſerves <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>fol.</hi> 80. <hi>de repub.</hi> was not the Majeſty of the Commonwealth in him, but he a Provider and Procurator of the People, and was bound to give an account of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And the reaſon why the <hi>Dictator</hi> and <hi>Archon</hi> were not abſolute Governors, is plain, becauſe this power was not immediately in them from God, but delegate and conſtituted from another; And any power that makes any thing, may alter it; for, <hi>Unumquodque diſſolvi poteſt eo ligamine quo ligatum eſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well, but let us ſee what manner of beaſt our Authors <hi>Abſolute Governor</hi> is. Why, our Author tells you, he is an <hi>Abſolute Governor, but reſtrained and tied up to certain Laws and Limits.</hi> Which is a contradiction and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; for in being abſolute, he is freed from all Laws and Limitations. And now I will tell our Author, that if his abſolute Governor be tied up to any humane Limits or Laws, he has ſo little power, that it is impoſſible for him to protect and defend his rational people: For ſuppoſe the Laws he is reſtrained to, be as many as are contained in the body of the Civil Law, our Statutes, and all the Acts and Ordinances made ſince 1641. and twenty times more, yet would not this be ſufficient for an abſolute Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: For all theſe are finite, and mens actions are infinite; and therefore Enemies may find out ſuch ways to invade this free people, as this abſolute Governor cannot find in his Laws, where he has power to oppoſe them;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:200520:39"/> and ſo this rational freeborn people muſt be left deſtitute, if any Enemy may be found who can outwit them, and find a way to oppreſs them out of the Laws and Limits which they have given their abſolute Governor. And who will deſire any greater advantage againſt another, then to have him look always one way? or what Enemy deſires more againſt another, then againſt ſuch a one whoſe abſolute Governor is tied up to certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and thoſe known to themſelves? And Laws are things which muſt be <hi>in eſſe;</hi> And how can any man tell to day, what may happen to morrow? but Princes muſt to morrow, and next day, and every day, ſteer their courſe according as the wind and ſtorms, ſhoals and deeps, &amp;c. repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves, which no man can poſſibly foreſee.</p>
                     <p>Well, let us ſee what the reſtriction of any one thing in the <hi>Supream Prince,</hi> may bring upon himſelf and Subjects? Let us look upon a <hi>King of England</hi> after the Act of Parliament, <hi>De tallagio non concedendo</hi> (an Act of Parliament, is the Act of the King in Parliament, As when the Lords and Commons preſent any Bill to the King, and he paſſes it; this is an Act of Parliament, which is no more a Law of the Lords and Commons, then the Laws paſſed at the Petition or Rogation of <hi>Coelius, Caſsius, Sempronius, &amp;c.</hi> were the Laws of <hi>Coelius, Caſsius,</hi> and <hi>Sempronius.)</hi> And let every King expect, that whatſoever the Subject can get of the King <hi>by hook or crook,</hi> he will hold that as faſt, as the King ſhall any flower he leaves in his Crown.</p>
                     <p>Well then, if <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt will not paſs this Law, he gets not a groat of his Subjects in <hi>England</hi> towards the relief of his oppreſſed Subjects of <hi>Aquitain</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in his Comment upon this Statute obſerves.</p>
                     <p>Well then, the <hi>Scots</hi> in the year One thouſand ſix hundred and forty (having-tranſgreſſed all Laws of God and Humanity, as well as the Borders and Bounds of their own Countrey) raiſe Arms the ſecond time, and make an invaſion upon us, and ſeiſe upon <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Newcastle;</hi> (but though the <hi>Kings</hi> hands were tyed up, yet the Divine Vengeance of Heaven ſhall overtake them and their Countrey, by a hand they could ſo little fear, as I believe few of them knew whether there were any ſuch, or no.) And now oh you! who have not forced all mankinde from Humane breſts, come and ſtand amazed with horror for the moſt deplorable condition, of the moſt Pious, the moſt Religious, the moſt Juſt, the moſt Chaſte, Vertuous, and Sereneſt <hi>Prince,</hi> that ever ſwayed the Engliſh Scepter, and not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd by any Countrey whatſoever?</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> having invaded this Nation to treat with them a ſecond time, was too too much an indignity for their Natural Soveraign; beſides, it was an affront not to be endured by the Engliſhmen, That their Countrey muſt be made a prey to ſuch Locuſts and Caterpillers, whenſoever they will pretend grievance in <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline:</hi> To reſtrain them by force, it could not be without raiſing money; <hi>By this Statute the King,</hi> they ſay, <hi>can raiſe none, but by Parliament;</hi> and to call a Parliament in this mad conjuncture of times, was judged by himſelf and Council, to be a means to increaſe the power of the <hi>Scots,</hi> by the Parliaments joyning with them, to the endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf and his Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>Well then, what is to be done? what ſtand ſtill and look on, while theſe hungry Vermine devour and make a prey of his afflicted Subjects?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:200520:40"/> No, the King to make his goodneſs appear above his own danger, calls a Parliament; where not deceived in his expectation, the <hi>Scots</hi> and they are <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> ſtraight, ſworn Brethren; and the firſt thing agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them was, That Humane Blood muſt be offered up to them; (a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to a greater Draught) nor muſt <hi>Strafford</hi> ſuffer by an ordinary way of Judicature by his Peers, but that the King may be involved in the ſame Crime with themſelves, he muſt die by Act of Parliament; and then having made the King to diveſt himſelf of all poſſible power to defend himſelf, when ever they will ſtrike him, they give the <hi>Scots</hi> Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds to be exported out of the Kingdom, becauſe they had made a prey, and devoured the goods of their fellow Subjects in the four Northern Counties, which (forſooth!) theſe good Saints call <hi>Brotherly Aſsiſtance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>See, oh ſee here, O my Countrymen, the Aſſertors and Avengers of the Honor of the Engliſh Nation! Theſe are the Noble Patriots of their Priviledges, I am ſure not of your Liberties! Theſe are the glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of our Church and State! Theſe are they who in order to ſo many Proteſtations, Declarations, Swearings and forſwearings, have made <hi>Charls</hi> a more glorious King then any of his Predeceſſors, more feared abroad and more renowned at home!</p>
                     <p>And now tell me, whether you had not better at firſt have given your pence and your two pences, then paid your pounds and forty ſhillings ſince, you knew not for what. Nor was our caſe much unlike the caſe of the <hi>Constantinopolitans,</hi> who alleaging Poverty and Priviledge in oppoſition to their Safety and Defence, became a prey to the <hi>Turks,</hi> 1453. their moſt mercileſs enemies, who put them all to the ſword; the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves wondering there ſhould be ſo much wealth in the World, as was found in the ſacking of this one City.</p>

                     <p>And here our Author calls them <hi>Tyrannical, &amp;c.</hi> What's the matter? Have they too much power?

Why ſure Nature intended that the beſt things ſhould be uſed, and who better uſe them then the <hi>King?</hi> What, are many of their Subjects poor and miſerable?

And if any of theſe Tyrannical Governors (as our Author calls them) ſhould diveſt themſelves of all their power and greatneſs, yet there would not be fewer poor laboring men: And let our Author ſhew me in any of theſe Goverments half ſo many Slaves and miſerable men, as I will ſhew him have been under the <hi>Romans</hi> and other popular States. Nor need any man in any of theſe be a Slave, if he will become <hi>Renegado</hi> to his Faith and Religion; whereas under the <hi>Romans, &amp;c.</hi> they were neceſſitated to it at the will of their Lords. Will they, if they fear the power of any man to grow too great, uſe means not fully warrantable in the known Laws, either to make it leſs, or none at all? why, the <hi>Portian</hi> Law preſcribed only baniſhment to the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> in any offence; yet <hi>Cethegus, Lentulus, Longinus, &amp;c.</hi> were put to death for being agents in <hi>Catilines</hi> Conſpiracie.

                        <hi>WE have long talked of a Supreme Governor; it is time we ſhould point him out, that he may be known.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> Our Author has talked long indeed, and to very little purpoſe of his Supreme Governor, and now he thinks it high time to point him out, that he may be known; and he thinks he has already ſo ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him, that any Ingenious Rational Man may eaſily diſcern him, and ſo takes leave of him, and tells us, All agree there are three ſorts of Government, <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> and that they may be mixed: May they ſo? Then ſure they may be more then three, <hi>viz. Monarchy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy; Monarchy</hi> mixed with <hi>Ariſtocracy, Monarchy</hi> mixed with <hi>Democracy,</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> mixed both with <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> and <hi>Democracy: Aristocracy</hi> mixed with <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy</hi> mixed with <hi>Democracy,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> mixed with both; and ſo <hi>Democracy</hi> mixed with <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy,</hi> and both. So that either theſe three ſorts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will admit of no mixture, or elſe there may be above three ſorts of Government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> The next ſtumble (for ſteps our Author makes none) is, <hi>What</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy <hi>is, if it be mixed</hi> (but if it be mixed, how can it be <hi>Monarchy?</hi> for <hi>Regia Majeſtas eſt indiviſibilis) with</hi> Ariſtocracy <hi>or</hi> Democracy, <hi>ſo that they be continually joynt Actors, the</hi> Monarch <hi>is but a Servant, and the other part the Maſter.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> Could any Man give a name to this Government, it muſt be either Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchy, or Demo-monarchy; in plain Engliſh the chief Government of one Man alone, or the People-Government of one alone; but this is, our Author ſaies, but only when they are joint Actors, and then the Monarch is but a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Did ever any Man talk ſo ſenſeleſly, as if he underſtood neither words nor
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:200520:42"/> meaning? for Monarchy is the Government of one Perſon alone, which is impoſſible if it be ſubſervient to the Government of any Court or People, unleſs our Author can make a Court or People not conſiſting of Men. Nor is the Inſtants he gives of the <hi>Italian</hi> Dogs, and <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Kings, any thing to the purpoſe; for who in the World ever heard of the Monarch of <hi>Venice, Genoa,</hi> or <hi>Lacedemon?</hi> It is true indeed that <hi>Euriſthenes</hi> and his Brother <hi>Procles,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Aristodemus,</hi> Grandchildren of <hi>Cleodaeus,</hi> Great Grandchildren of <hi>Hyllus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Adnepotes</hi> of <hi>Hercules,</hi> were the firſt two Kings of <hi>Lacedemon, Anno mundi</hi> 2848. and out of their two Families called the <hi>Eurypontidan,</hi> and <hi>Agidan,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> did joyntly reign, until that about the year of the world 3777. <hi>Eurydamadas</hi> was the laſt of the <hi>Eurypontidan</hi> family, deſcended from <hi>Procles,</hi> and almoſt at the ſame time <hi>Cleomines</hi> the laſt of the <hi>Agidan</hi> family, deſcended from <hi>Euryſthenes,</hi> was overcome by <hi>Antigonus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon.</hi> Yet could not this Government be properly called <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but <hi>Duarchy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> Nor leſs childiſh is his mixture of <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> for theſe will as little admit of mixture as any other. But ſee what a wiſe obſervation he makes, <hi>viz. The quarrel to be more ballanced, becauſe the Government is divided in its ſelf, and therefore dangerous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> So then, the mixture of <hi>Monarchy</hi> with either or both the other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, makes no diviſion; or to what purpoſe does our Author take notice of this dangerous mixture only in theſe two? and then our Author makes no doubt, <hi>but if Ariſtocracy gets power enough, ſhe is in poſture of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority.</hi> Very wittily obſerved, and a very great doubt wiſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Author.</label> Monarchy <hi>and</hi> Democracy <hi>can hardly be ſo mixed, that</hi> Democracy <hi>be perpetual, and</hi> Monarchy <hi>by ſpurts: for that is not</hi> Monarchy; <hi>the ſaid Monarch being not long enough in Power to be accounted a ſetled Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, as we ſee in the</hi> Decemvirs, Tribunes <hi>and</hi> Dictators <hi>among the</hi> Romans.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Obſerv.</label> So then, here is <hi>Monarchy</hi> mixed with <hi>Democracy,</hi> and not mixed; and why not mixed? becauſe forſooth it is by ſpurts, and not long enough to be accounted a ſetled Magiſtrate; no, how long then ſettles a Magiſtrate our Author no where ſaies; but if he had learned a very little Logick, he might have known that <hi>majus &amp; minus non variant ſpeciem,</hi> and a Magiſtrate of an hours ſettlement, is as much a Magiſtrate, as if he had been one never ſo long. And then ſee the wild inſtance of the Man, for although in the <hi>Roman</hi> Dictators there were ſome ſhadow of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> yet in the <hi>Tribunes</hi> being two, and the <hi>Decemvirs</hi> being ten, there could be no poſſible colour thereof, unleſs our Author by his Logick can make two Men and ten Men to be but one Man alone.

How much greater power had our Author in this Government than <hi>Themistocles</hi> his Child had over the <hi>Grecians?</hi> For in all our Authors Government you ſhall find two degrees of Compariſon above the ſuperlative, <hi>viz.</hi> the peoples Power over their ſupreme and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Governor, and our Authors ſupreme ſupremeſt Power, who has a Power when he will, to make what he liſt the Peoples Laws, which ſhall oblige and tie up their abſolute Governor; And when the toy takes him, they ſhall be the Governors Laws; And <hi>Ground</hi> 11. latter end, <hi>No ſupreme Magiſtrate can be bound to any Laws, contrary to</hi> (what our Author or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor ſhall call) <hi>good Government.</hi> And now who would think ſo wiſe a fellow as our Author, who in this Government had ſuch a monſtrous and moſt unlimited ſoveraignty, ſhould (by ſhewing his power in giving

                     <p>Well, but let us ſee whether upon our Authors principles this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be diſſolved, or be in the power of his People or Rational mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. All Men who have written of the Cauſe and Nature of things, have put a difference between Natural, and Voluntary or Rational cauſes or things.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is firſt Axiome or Principle he begs, both in the Preface, and ſecond Article of the firſt Book <hi>De Cive,</hi> is, <hi>That the beginning of Civil Society, is from Mutual Fear.</hi> Yet in his Preface, and ſecond Annotation upon this Article, <hi>He fears that ſome men may deny it; yea, it is true, that very many men do deny it.</hi> 
                  </p>
                  <p>This therefore being required for a Principle, and the firſt Principle, and by conſequence not to be proved, but to prove all that may be inferred from it; and ſince that he grants that very many do deny this Principle; Then by very many men muſt the whole body of <hi>De Cive</hi> be rejected: For, <hi>Contra negantes principia non est diſputandum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if men will not grant this Principle, (in the <hi>Pref.</hi> and <hi>Annot.</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) he will prove it ſo, that he will make them aſhamed of it; and how, think you? (It will be ſomewhat odd, ſure, to prove Principles.) He tells you, <hi>That all Cities, although they be at peace with their neighbors, yet keep Garriſons and Soldiers upon their Frontiers: And that when men go to ſleep, they ſhut their doors; and that men taking a journey, do it with a ſword; and that men treat uſually, before they fight.</hi>

Beſides, it is a contradiction, to ſay any thing is a Principle, which can be proved; for that which proves it, is prime and a principle to it.

                     <label>Obſerv.</label> As if that men were not obliged to ſubmit to higher Powers, <hi>not only for wrath,</hi> (take it in what ſenſe you will, either fear of the wrath of the higher Powers, or mutual fear of the wrath of other men) <hi>but alſo for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake:</hi> And that God were not in gratitude to be worſhiped and ſerved by ingenuous men, becauſe he is good, and created them intellectual and reaſonable creatures; but only by a ſervile fear of his Judgments, from whence only vile and vitious men ſeem to, but never truly ſerve or honor him.

                  <p>He divides the whole Treatiſe into three titles, viz. <hi>Liberty, Empire,</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> Under the title of <hi>Liberty,</hi> he ſpeaks of men as they are in a ſtate of meer Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> of a ſtate of men before they have by Pact given up their natural right to one Perſon, or one Court or Company of men; ſo that the will of this Man, or Court, ſhall be the will of all of them; and this he calls <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>art.</hi> 9. <hi>Civitas,</hi> or <hi>Perſona civilis.</hi>

                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Rom. 2. 14.</note> does, <hi>viz.</hi> of men who have only the Law of Nature, and not Gods Divine Law ſupernaturally revealed in the Scriptures, to be their rule and guide; and that men in ſuch a ſtate not having the Law, may by Nature do the things contained in the Law, (for this Law is ingraven in the hearts of all men) he ſhould have diſputed without an Adverſary for me. But when he makes all men <hi>Jure naturali</hi> (which is ſuperior, and the cauſe of all Laws of Nature) to be equal, and in a parity of condition, and every man by his own natural right to have a power over every man, and to kill and deſtroy them, whenſoever it ſeems good unto him, and yet without any ſin; and that this State is only to be cured by the Laws of Nature of his own making, (although he would have them to be Divine Laws, and contrary to Natural rights) is ſuch a monſtrous Paradox and abſurdity, as I wonder any Ingenuous man ſhould aſſent to it.</p>
                  <p>Under the title of <hi>Empire,</hi> he is not leſs wild and extravagant in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions to the thing, be it <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Court,</hi> created by <hi>Do</hi> or <hi>Dedi,</hi> and not <hi>Dabo</hi> or <hi>Faciam:</hi> For he makes it not only Soveraign Judge of all Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, as well as Civil cauſes; but alſo impoſſible to command any thing contrary to the Law of Nature. Yet he makes the Law of Nature, the Law of God; and this Creature of creatures to be ſo infallible, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to command any thing contrary to it.</p>
                  <p>It is not worth the examining, what he would have under the title of <hi>Religion;</hi> for men ſay, the man is of none himſelf, and complains (they ſay) he cannot walk the ſtreets, but the Boys point at him, ſaying, <hi>There goes HOBBS the Atheiſt!</hi> It may be therefore the reaſon, why in all his Laws of Nature, he allows no place for the Worſhip and Service of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is time to examine the particular Articles, upon which this Body <hi>De Cive</hi> is built.</p>

Secondly, no Contract can be of Rights, but only of things in poſſeſſion: The act of two or more mutually transferring, is the act of two or more giving, not contracting.</p>

Nor was there at that time, or ever before, any ſuch thing as <hi>iſta Curia,</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy ever heard of: For the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> deſired a King to judge them like to all the Nations; and at that time was <hi>Codrus</hi> King of the <hi>Athenians, Smendes</hi> or <hi>Semendes</hi> King of the <hi>Sicyonians, Aletes</hi> King of the <hi>Corinthians, Euryſthenes</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> So that in thoſe days, not among the <hi>Grecians</hi> was there ever ſo much as Ariſtocracy or Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy heard of.

Nor was there origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ever any Government, but Monarchy; and that never from any Pacts of men: And this Government ſo continued everywhere, until it was violated by ſeditious and rebellious men.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he makes this Civil Pact to be ſo neceſſary, and antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all Civil Government; I would fain know of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> whether <hi>Saul, David, Solomon, Jehu, Hazael, Cyrus, &amp;c.</hi> were not as much Kings, or <hi>Civitates</hi> (as he calls them) as if they had all this Covenanting and making Pacts one with another, That this mans will ſhould be the will of them all, Not to reſiſt the will of <hi>David, Solomon, Hazael, &amp;c.</hi> in thoſe things which they deemed neceſſary for the peace of the <hi>Iſraelites, Perſians, Syrians, &amp;c.?</hi> But if theſe were <hi>Civitates,</hi> (as if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> be a Chriſtian, which I think may be a queſtion, he muſt needs confeſs) and yet not made ſo by his Civil pacts, nor indeed any other; Then is this <hi>Unio</hi> ſo far from being eſſential or neceſſary to the making of a King or <hi>Civitas,</hi> that as to the right of a King, it is no matter whether it be made or not: For men, if they do not ſubmit, and conſent to rightful Kings government, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey God. <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 15.</note>

Beſides, Society being natural, it is an abſurd queſtion; and a man may as well ask, why God made the world in that order and frame that he hath; or how he came to make Man a reaſonable creature, and all other irrational, as why a ſociable?</p>
                  <p>Well, but if he ſhall ſay, that Laws ought to be known; and if Kings reign by Gods law, then how can any man know that this man is King in this place, and that man King in another place? I anſwer, That I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſhew this man by Gods law to be King here, and that man to be King there, when any man ſhall ſhew me by any Humane law, that any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual man is heir to any Eſtate. And if there be that excellencie in truth, that a right Heir to the meaneſt Eſtate be rarely ſuppreſſed; then is this excellencie of truth more perſpicuous, whenas I am confident that the right Heir to a Crown was never ſo ſuppreſſed, but he was ever believed to be ſo by them, who had never ſeen him, and moſt hated him. Beſides, <hi>Jus</hi> is <hi>duplex, Jus proprietatis, &amp; poſſeſsionis; Jus ad rem,</hi> and <hi>Jus in re.</hi> And therefore any Prince who is poſſeſt of a Crown, has a Title good enough againſt any man elſe, but him who hath the <hi>Jus proprietatis,</hi> or <hi>Jus ad rem.</hi> And therefore ought no man, upon penalty of Damnation, to <hi>reſist the Higher powers which are,</hi> that is, which are in poſſeſſion, if it does not clearly <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> and evidently appear, that this is only pretended power, and force indeed, to the diſpoſſeſſion and diſinheritance of another, againſt whoſe right and title no juſt exception can be taken. Let this ſuffice here; we ſhall take occaſion to diſcourſe hereof more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>I would fain know of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> Who gave the People this power of making Kings, or <hi>Civitates?</hi> or what are the People that have, or when was it, that they had it? At what age in pure nature, ſhall any man claim this right of giving up his Will, or be an Inſtrument of making this Civil Pact? or who ſhall define this time? Whether Women be not part of Mankind, and have not Wills as much or more then Men; and are not as liable to puniſhment for not obſervance, or tranſgreſſing humane Laws, as Men? Whether it be not reaſonable, Poſterity may not give up their Wills to another, ſince they have not the ſame Wills with their Anceſtors? Whether the Ten Tribes did not rebel in giving up their Wills to make <hi>Jeroboam</hi> King, though neither they or their anceſtors ever made <hi>Rehoboam, Solomon,</hi> or <hi>David</hi> King, by giving up their Wills? Whether the King or <hi>Civitas</hi> claiming all right and power from the Multitude, and every one of the Multitude claiming all right and power from the King or <hi>Civitas,</hi> be not <hi>Idem per idem?</hi> And let any man judge whether there be any thing more unreaſonable then this mans <hi>Dictamen rectae Rationis.</hi>

                  <p>But this Community (he ſays) which Man deſires, <hi>is not of whatſoever Community, but of peaceable, and ordained for the manner of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with them who are of his own kind: which Community the Stoicks called</hi>

                     <label>Obſerv.</label> Does any Creature that lives in flocks and herds, not deſire the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of its own kind? and therefore Hogs, Deer and Goats keep in herds, and Sheep in flocks. Or does any man think that <hi>Grotius</hi> could ever imagine, that his Countrimen did deſire Society or Community with other Nations for their Underſtanding, or Profit? If they deſire this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or Community for Profit, then are they out of <hi>Grotius</hi> his firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple proper to Man; and for ought I can underſtand, as very Beaſts, as any who deſire to live in Community.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Cynthius aurem vellit:</hi> For, ſays he, <hi>Quod ergo dicitur natura, quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que animal ad ſuas tantum utilitates ferri, ita univerſe ſumptum, concedi non debet. What thing therefore is called Nature, and that every Creature is carried only to their profits, ought not to be granted ſo univerſally taken. For even ſome of other living Creatures, the ſtudy of their profit, partly in reſpect of their young ones, partly in reſpect of others of like kind with themſelves,</hi> aliquatenus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Obſerv.</label> Is not here a Principle well defined! What ſo much as Equivocation can be taken againſt this, or the other Principle of Men, and Beaſts? or indeed, what Man or Beaſt does underſtand any thing clearly from either of them? How does this man take <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> one onely way to attain to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>viz.</hi> from known and manifeſt things, to find out things leſs known and more obſcure; whenas his very Principles are ſo obſcure and equivocal, as either they are not to be underſtood, or may ſignifie one thing as well as another? Nay, let any man ſee if he makes not his Countrimen generally verier Beaſts then many other; for they have no reſpect of others of like kind with themſelves, but only ſtudy their own profit: <note n="*" place="margin">Grotius.</note> 
                     <hi>Which thing we believe, in them, does proceed from ſome outward underſtanding principle; Ex principio aliquo intelligente extrinſeco.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <label>Obſerv.</label> Has he not now well mended the matter, thus by a new term (I believe never before heard of, nor for ought I underſtand, to be underſtood) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane a thing obſcure, by a term more obſcure? But the matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is not, from what Principle Beaſts deſire Society; but, whether they deſire Society, or not?</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:200520:51"/>
                  <p> When he is got looſe from theſe Principles, he then ſaies, <hi>But this</hi>

                     <hi>keeping of ſociety, which in a rude manner we have expreſſed convenient to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane intellect, is, the fountain of that right or law</hi> (ejus juris) <hi>which is properly ſo called, by which abstinence from what is anothers, obligation to perform promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, reparation for wrong done, &amp;c. do appertain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Obſerv.</label> But ſure the Man does much forget himſelf; for in this Community he here ſpeaks of, there can be no <hi>meum</hi> or <hi>tuum,</hi> and therefore no <hi>alienum,</hi> and by conſequence no <hi>alieni abſtinentia;</hi> nor can any Man perform any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, who can have nothing wherewith to perform; nor make reparation for wrong, when he can neither do any, nor has any thing to repair it withall.</p>
                  <p>Then he tells us, <hi>From this ſignification of Right or Law</hi> (ab hac <note place="margin">Grotius.</note> juris ſignificatione) <hi>flowed another larger, which</hi> (he ſaies a little after) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſists in diſcerning what delights or hurts us, and in judging how things ſhould be wiſely diſtributed.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <label>Obſerv.</label> What is there in this, which is proper to Man? does not every other Creature by an inſtinct in nature (which God has given inſtead of reaſon) diſcern much better then any Man does, what thing delights, and hurts them? and all oviparal creatures more wiſely diſtribute to their young ones, then the wiſeſt Man can to his Children.</p>
                  <p>He defines <hi>jus naturale,</hi> to be <hi>Dictatum rectae rationis indicans actui</hi>

                     <hi>alicui, ex ejus convenientia, aut diſconvenientia, cum ipſa natura rationali, ineſſe moralem turpitudinem aut neceſsitatem moralem, ac conſequenter ab auctore naturae Deo talem actum aut vetari aut praecipi.</hi> The Law of nature is the dictate of right reaſon, ſhewing to any action, from its convenience or diſconvenience with Rational nature, that there is in it a Moral turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or a Moral neceſſity, and conſequently ſuch an act is commanded or forbidden by God the Author of Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Obſerv.</label> Would not any man after all this adoe, expect that <hi>Grotius</hi> had defined ſomething? But if <hi>definitio</hi> be <hi>excluſio aequivoci,</hi> then is that no definition which may ſignifie one thing as well as another; and if humane actions convenient or diſconvenient with Rational nature, may be prudent and profitable, aſwell as Juſt and Moral, then is there not in every action con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and diſconvenient with the Rational nature, a Moral turpitude or neceſſity; and ſo every ſuch action is not the Law of Nature, and ſo neither commanded nor forbidden by God. But I forgive <hi>Grotius</hi> in this, not having defined any thing leſs equivocally: as alſo his every where confounding <hi>jus</hi> with <hi>lex,</hi> in regard the <hi>Romans, Civilians,</hi> and generally Lawyers do ſo; yet thus much I do affirm, that if <hi>jus</hi> and <hi>lex</hi> according to <hi>Calepine,</hi> do differ as <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> or at leaſt as the cauſe and effect; (for it is impoſſible there ſhould be <hi>lex lata</hi> where there was not <hi>jus legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum</hi> ſuperior, and the cauſe of the Law) then he which writes of theſe things muſt diſtinguiſh and define them, or he ſhall never write clearly, or be clearly underſtood in any thing which he writes of them.</p>
                  <p>But though he makes <hi>jus naturale</hi> to be <hi>dictatum rectae rationis, viz.</hi> a liberty or abſtinence to every Man, to do or not do whatſoever is reaſonable <note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <label>Obſerv.</label> So that his Principles before were either equivocal, or obſcure; And here is one, which ſignifies contradictory, and impoſſible things.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things therefore granted, and being the eaſie, and known Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples upon which <hi>Grotius</hi> laies his foundation, and ſo plain and perſpicuous, as no exception, nay not ſo much as equivocation can be taken againſt them, any of them, or any part of them; Sure he ſhall not need much to uſe the help of Geometry, to build a moſt exact and noble Structure, which ſhall not only be a Land-mark, but alſo a Sea-mark for all Kings and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, now and hereafter to govern and ſteer their actions by, <hi>tam per mare, quàm per terram,</hi> as well by Land as Sea; but alſo a ſecure Rule for Subjects to continue their obedience, until they pretend a neceſſity for rebellion; if otherwiſe they cannot find ſome relief out of ſuch popular Orators as <hi>Cicero, Demoſthenes, Cleon, &amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſhall eſteem of like weight with any teſtimony of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>It is a moſt pleaſant thing to ſee the excellencie of Truth in her pure and ſimple nakedneſs, how plain, eaſie, and beautiful ſhe appears: whereas Falſhood, with all the art, learning and induſtry of man, is ſtill rendred more perplext, confuſed and dark, by how much is added to it.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to what a volume here has <hi>Grotius</hi> increaſed his <hi>Jus Naturale!</hi> Sometime it is <hi>Jus divinum voluntarium, jus divinum, jus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum, jus humanum voluntarium, jus gentium, jus civile, jus latius patens, jus arctius patens, jus conſtitutum, jus immutabile, jus commune, jus gladii, jus divinum perfectius, jus belli ſolenne, jus belli minus ſolenne, jus precarium, jus revocabile, jus uſufructuarium, jus temporarium, jus armorum movendorum magiſtratuum minorum, jus naturae pro certo ſtatu, jus rectorium, jus aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium, jus ſuperveniens regis, jus externum, jus internum, jus exterorum ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venienti dominio, jus pignoris, jus retentionis, jus ſervitutis, jus luendi pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoris, jus tranſeundi, jus morandi, jus habitandi, jus habendi loca deſerta, jus reductive, jus reſtrictive, jus gentium improprie, jus derelictum, jus quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum, jus feciale, jus externum efficax, jus reale, jus inventionis, jus primi occupantis, jus proprietatis, jus poſſeſsionis, jus dominii, jus herile, jus paternum, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas if he had made uſe of that plain and ſhort Sentence, which the greateſt Glory of all the Heathen Roman Emperors profeſſed he learned <note place="margin">Alex. Severus.</note> of the Chriſtians, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, ne feceris alteri;</hi> it would have ſignified infinitely more, then is contained in all the confuſed obſcurity which he impoſes upon the world in this Book <hi>De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> founded upon this falſe and feigned Principle of the <hi>Original right and power of the People,</hi> from whence he derives all power in Government. For, art thou a Subject? thou wouldeſt not willingly any man ſhould forceably or fraudulently take any thing, which the Law has given thee, from thee; Do not thou ſo by another. Is he a King? he would not have his Subjects wronged by another; Let not him wrong another Kings Subjects. If one Subject does another wrong, the Law is open; he who is wronged may have relief by Action or Complaint, not by Arms. If one King does wrong to another, he who is wronged has God and his ſword to defend himſelf, and do juſtice upon his Adverſary. And whether the doing, or not doing ſuch a thing be wrong or injury, is every King, and not <hi>Grotius</hi> Judge, and God the Judge of every King.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:200520:52"/>
                  <p> It is true, that in all Faculties whatſoever, and in all Arts and Sciences, men muſt uſe Terms to expreſs what they conceive by any general Notion and Theſis, <hi>(Et ab univerſalibus ad particularia ratiocinando, oritur ſcientia)</hi> and muſt alter their Terms as they proceed from one thing to another, and add to them in the ſpecifications of them; (for, <hi>Omnis additio probat mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem.)</hi> But no man (who deſires to be underſtood, or who deſires to underſtand himſelf) will undertake ſuch a task as <hi>Grotius</hi> here does, to compile a Volume upon ſuch contradictory, equivocal, and obſcure Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: For, <hi>Concluſio ſequitur deteriorem partem.</hi> And if any part of a Propoſition be but probable, though the Sillogiſm be made in the cleareſt Mood, yet the Concluſion is no more.</p>
                  <p>And any man may much better thus reaſon, then <hi>Grotius</hi> does:—A right-lined Figure, is that which is comprehended under right lines; and that which is comprehended under three right lines, is a right-lined Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle. <hi>Sciendum praeterea, &amp;c.</hi> It is to be further underſtood, Right-lined Figures are not only ſuch as are contained under right lines, but may ſerve for many other things beſides. So, Spherical Figures, as they are now uſed by Aſtronomers, the invention of man has found out; but being found out, theſe right-lined Figures may ſerve for them alſo; (for, Spherical and right-lined Figures have many things common to them both; as when they are cut tranſverſe, they are cut to right angles; and in Spherical and right-lined Triangles, two ſides is more then the third, howſoever taken; and in both, the ſides have the ſame proportion one to another, that their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite angles have; nor are they in any thing contrary one to another:) Yet if any man ſhall take a Spherical and right-lined Triangle for the ſame thing, (as <hi>Grotius</hi> does <hi>Jus Naturale,</hi> which he makes to ſignifie Community and Property, in the ſame Principle, which are contrary one to another) I make no doubt but he might compile as big a Volume, and almoſt as little to be underſtood, as this <hi>De jure Belli &amp; Pacis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, but let us ſee why <hi>Jus Naturale</hi> is immutable by God himſelf. (Note, <hi>Grotius</hi> every where almoſt confounds <hi>Jus</hi> with <hi>Lex;</hi> and here he takes <hi>Jus Naturale,</hi> for <hi>Lex Naturae.)</hi> For, <hi>Although</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the power of God is immenſe, yet ſome things may be ſaid to be, to which it does not extend it ſelf; becauſe thoſe things ſo ſaid, are only ſaid, and have no ſenſe which may expreſs the thing, but are repugnant to themſelves: So that twice Two ſhould not make Four, cannot be effected by God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Obſerv.</label> It is true, that God cannot make contradictory things, and things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to agree, and to be the ſame. But this is nothing to <hi>Grotius</hi> his purpoſe, for a Similitude proves nothing; nor is there any analogie between the things propounded by <hi>Grotius:</hi> For though things ſimply neceſſary be <note place="margin">If <hi>Lex lata</hi> had any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon the Legiſlator, then were the Creator obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the creature; than which there is nothing more blaſphemous.</note> immutable by God, yet the Law of Nature is the Law of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being a creature of God's, it cannot have any obligation upon God; but being the Law of God given to Mankind, it is immutable by them; and God might, if it had pleaſed him, have given ſomething elſe for the Law of Nature to Mankind. Both <hi>Grotius</hi> his Poſitions therefore in this Section are manifeſtly falſe, abſurd, and blaſphemous, viz. <hi>That the Law of Nature is immutable by God himſelf;</hi> And, <hi>That</hi> Uſus communis <hi>is</hi> Jure naturali, <hi>and yet mutable by the will of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if I be demanded to ſhew an example, that God is not obliged to the Law of Nature, or that the Law of Nature is not immutable by God:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:200520:53"/> I ſay, <hi>Jus ſuum cuique tribuere,</hi> is from the Law of Nature; yet did the Children of Iſrael borrow Jewels of gold, of ſilver, and raiment of the <note place="margin">Ex. 12. 15, 16.</note> Egyptians, and all ſuch things as they required of them, and ſpoiled them by not making reſtitution, without any violence upon the Law of Nature, becauſe God commanded them; nay, they had ſinned and diſobeyed God, if they had not done it. And ſo by the Law of Nature, every Father is obliged to preſerve and nouriſh his children; yet becauſe when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up and kill his ſon <hi>Iſaac, Abraham</hi> was obedient to God and would have done it, God takes it for the higheſt act of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith, and ſwears by himſelf, <hi>That in bleſsing he would bleſs him, and in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>multiplying he would multiply his ſeed as the ſtars of heaven, &amp;c.</hi> Yet can no man borrow, with a reſolution of not-reſtitution; nor any Father put his Son without cauſe to death, where God does not command, though all the world ſhould command it, without a violence upon the Law of Nature. Nay I ſay, the Laws of Nature being eternal, there was never any time when men ought not to give every man his due; and ſo by conſequence, no time when <hi>Grotius</hi> his <hi>Uſus communis</hi> was, ſince Men were born; but ever ſince Men were in the world, Dominion and Property have been. <hi>Cain</hi> had his <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 3, 4.</note> Fruit of the Tillage of the ground, and <hi>Abel</hi> had his Flock and the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of his Flock; neither of which could be, if <hi>Grotius</hi> his <hi>Uſus communis</hi> had been.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Object.</label> But you may ſay, Property preſuppoſes humane Laws, which muſt give it; and humane Laws muſt happen in ſucceſſion of time: And that therefore before theſe humane Laws were, there could be no Property, and by conſequence, all things were common and undivided.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Sol.</label> For the ſatisfying of this doubt, we muſt conſider that God, in the Creation, only created one Man, and out of him made Woman; and that ever ſince no Man was ever made, but the ſpecies of Mankind hath been continued by generation. I grant that all things were common to <hi>Adam</hi> (except the forbidden fruit;) but no Man that was ever born into the world (and not a Poſthumous King) who was not born in ſubjection to humane Laws. Nor did ever <hi>Adam</hi> derive this Legiſlative right which he had over his Wife and Children, by any Pact, Contract, or Submiſſion of his Wife and Children; but had it from God, becauſe he was firſt made. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 13.</note> It is therefore manifeſtly falſe, which theſe men beg, <hi>That by Nature all Men are equal, and that the will of Man brought in Dominion.</hi> Nor do theſe men ſhew out of any ſacred or prophane Hiſtory, that ever Dominion was brought in by Man, or that Men had things common and undivided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
                  <p>Well, but <hi>Grotius</hi> (having in this Paragraph, in a tedious unſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant <note place="margin">

For example: If a Creditor to whom I am obliged, takes what Lowe him; now I am not bound to pay, not becauſe the Law of nature leaves to command</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:200520:53"/>

                     <label>Obſerv.</label> It is true, that univerſal cauſes in nature produce nothing, but as meeting with particular material cauſes; the law of nature therefore of it ſelf produces nothing, but as meeting with particular material cauſes apted and diſpoſed for the law of nature to work upon; and therefore when theſe particular cauſes ceaſe, the obligation which the law of nature creates, ceaſes alſo. As, <hi>Thou ſhalt honor thy Father and Mother,</hi> is the law of nature; but then there muſt be Parents &amp; Children, or the law of nature creates no obligation; and therefore when the particular cauſe ceaſes, the obligation of the law of nature ceaſes alſo; as when Parents are dead, the law of nature in that particular can have no obligation upon their Children. And ſo in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which <hi>Grotius</hi> gives, a Debtor is by the law of nature obliged to pay his Creditor: but this Debt being paid, the particular cauſe ceaſing, the obligation of the law of nature ceaſes alſo. What need therefore was there of <hi>Arrianus</hi> his Greek out of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> to prove a prime and neceſſary truth, which is of more authority then forty <hi>Arrianuſes,</hi> and all the Greek in <hi>Epictetus, Grotius,</hi> and all his Authors and Poets to boot?</p>
                  <p>

Thus hath <hi>Grotius</hi> inſtead of clearly propounding his principles and orderly reaſoning from them, thatched a company of equivocal and contradictory principles, with Poets and Authors brought in by head and heels; ſo as not any one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is clearly ſtated and diſputed, but the whole Treatiſe a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and unſignificant thing.</p>

Admit, in caſe of neceſſity, God (who hath made all things for man, and man only for himſelf) hath diſpenced with many ſins which related only to him, for mans preſervation; (yet by <hi>Grotius</hi> his good leave, we muſt not go too far; for I do not ſee then, how the primitive Chriſtians ſhould have ſuffered martyrdom, and not have ſymbolized, or reſiſted the Gentiles:) yet it does not therefore follow, that any man may pretend any neceſſity, (nor can any one ſhew that ever God did diſpenſe withall) to tranſgreſs Gods command, and to do that wrong and injury to others, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to repair; as in Subjects making war againſt their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; for what recompence can be given for the blood and deſtruction which they bring upon them who obey their Superior?

                     <hi>he has ſhewed ſuch a Worſhip of God to be rational.</hi> But, ſays he, <hi>Men muſt have a care that they do not worſhip God ſo, where he reigns by Covenant, as by the Covenant of</hi> Abraham; <hi>for there it is ill done, whether it be done by the command of the</hi> Civitas, <hi>or not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whether as among the <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore, or with the Chriſtians now, (for I hope he will not deny God to reign as much over Chriſtians by Covenant, as ever he did over the <hi>Jews)</hi> how can any Man obey both, where contraries are commanded, if there be no paſſive obedience?

                  <p>We find but ſmall conſort yet between theſe three. Our Author <hi>makes it Rational for Subjects to reſist and depoſe.

                     <label>Obſerv.</label> But how ſhall I know whether in this? and therefore it is much better to obey, then venture to break Gods poſitive command. But Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> makes <hi>a ſubjection of Body and Souls abſolutely, where God reigns not by Covenant; and there too by diſtinguiſhing between things neceſſary, and not neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                  <p>Since there is ſo much conteſt about the power of the People, let us ſee what theſe three underſtand by the People. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> underſtands by <note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Salus populi ſuprema lex,</hi> is when the ſafety of the people or Subject is in danger; then the ſupream Governor is not to take notice of any Mans parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt whatſoever, he has ſworn to the contrary; as when an Invaſion, &amp;c. is made, though the King at his Coronation has ſworn not to oppreſs nor take without their conſents, from any of his Subjects, any thing, which any of his Subjects hold of him, or any of his Predeceſſors; yet rather then an Enemy ſhall be relieved by any of his particular Subjects, to the endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the reſt, he then may deſtroy it, for the ſafety of the people is the higheſt Law: and the end of all Government is, the preſervation of the Subjects in general; and in ſuch caſes the leſſer evil is to be choſen; and no Laws but will ſuffer a miſchief, rather then undergoe an inconvenience: And therefore could not the Dictator be queſtioned for any thing done during his Dictatorſhip, becauſe of the danger of the people; and ſo the <hi>Romans</hi> alwaies underſtood this Maxim of <hi>Salus Populi ſuprema lex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us ſee whether theſe Men leave Poſterity in any better condition, then they make the preſent Age, and ſee how they agree about ſucceſſion,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:200520:56"/> and whether a Kingdom may be aliened by the preſent King, or he name his ſucceſſor. Here we muſt look upon <hi>Grotius</hi> either naturally, or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and yet too, as neither: As he is naturally a <hi>Hogan Mogan,</hi> he makes the King an Uſufructuary only, and then he ſaies <hi>he can alter nothing</hi>

Becauſe of the damnable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents, which muſt needs follow from this determination, we will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all the parts of it.</p>
                  <p>He almoſt every where makes a great ſtir with <hi>populus, &amp; populus vult, &amp; populus mutare poteſt voluntatem expreſse, &amp; tacite;</hi> but never (that I can any where find) defines, what the People is. If he had ſaid the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the People of <hi>Athens,</hi> or the People of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> he had ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, though nothing to his purpoſe. For when a Man ſpeaks of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Athens,</hi> &amp;c. he ſpeaks not formally of Men, as born in the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Athenian</hi> territories; but as men who were <hi>civitate donati,</hi> which it may be were not the tenth part of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>Athenians;</hi> nor were ever the <hi>Roman, Athenian,</hi> or <hi>Syracuſan</hi> People, free People <hi>jure naturali</hi> (as he ſaies) but by Civil ſanction, having made themſelves ſo, unjuſtly uſurping do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the reſt in their Tyranny and Dominions. It cannot be then that <hi>Grotius</hi> means by People, ſuch People as were the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Athenians:</hi> If by People he means any thing in the world, for above this 1700 years, there have not been any ſuch upon the face of the earth (if the Inhabitants of <hi>Switzerland</hi> be not ſuch, who taking advantage from the remiſs Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> having beaten the Archduke <hi>Leopoldus</hi> about the year 1400, made themſelves a Democracy, and have almoſt ever ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Mercenary Man-killers to the intereſts of the Pope, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.) Grotius</hi> then not meaning ſuch People, as were the <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp;c. I cannot imagine what he ſhould mean by People, unleſs he means Men, Women, and Children of all ages and conditions, all of them in a parity or equal condition, abſtracted from all Laws of God, or Man; and what a Harmony of Confeſſions would ariſe from ſuch a rour, any ſober wiſe Man may judge? Thus much for his <hi>populus.</hi>

                     <label>Obſerv.</label> Well, but be the People what it will, a beaſt, or no beaſt, a thing, or nothing; it is from its will, all right of reigning proceeds, a <hi>cujus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate jus regnandi proficiſcitur.</hi> What, all Right of Governing, or Regal Power proceed from the People? faith, let <hi>Grotius,</hi> or any of his followers ſhew ever ſince the beginning of the world any King made by the People,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:200520:57"/> and I will grant him all the reſt, be it what it will: But ſee whether <hi>Grotius</hi> hath not a forked tongue, or not? here, and in twenty places more with <hi>Notandums,</hi> &amp;c. he makes all Regal Power to be from the wills of the People. In his Epiſtle to <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13. he ſaies, <hi>How beautiful, how glorious, how joyful to your Conſcience will it be, that when God ſhall have called thee to his Kingdom, which alone is better then thine, thou maiſt confidently ſay: I have received this ſword from thee for defence of Juſtice; this ſword I return to thee, pure and undefiled, raſhly guilty of no bloodſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Obſerv.</label> So that if he ſaies true, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13. had his ſword of Juſtice from God, then does he ſay falſe here, and in twenty places more, that all Power of Governing is from the wills of the people.</p>
                  <p>Well, but let us ſuppoſe a King made by the People; which is the party governing, and which is the party governed? all Government being in the predicament of Relation, where there is any one to govern or command, there muſt be another to be governed and commanded. Well then, here are two, the People, and the King made by the People, the one to govern, the other to be governed. Say now which is the party governing, the King or the People? it cannot be that the King ſhould be the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party, for he is but a Creature, and a thing made by the People, and the Creator cannot be ruled and governed by the Creature; the People then muſt be the party governing, and the King muſt be the party gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; the King therefore of <hi>France</hi> (whom he ſo much flatters) and all other Kings whatſoever, from this determination of <hi>Grotius,</hi> are the governed party, and the People their Subjects are the governing party. If therefore it be impoſſible to ſerve two Maſters, who by equal right command, I would fain know how it is poſſible for a King to obey above Ten hundred thouſand, every one of his Subjects having as much right to command him as another? and it is very like indeed to be a very well ordered Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and much conducing to the benefit and ſafety of the People, where there is many Hundred thouſands commanding, and one individual perſon obeying.</p>
                  <p>But good Man, he is very careful, that though the People give Kings all their Regal Power, that they part not with too much; nay though they make Kings, yet if you beleeve him, they part with nothing at all, for otherwhere he ſaies, <hi>Imperium quod per Reges exercetur, non deſinit impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium</hi>

                     <hi>populi.</hi> Is not here a pretty play of a King, and no King? a King without Power, and a People with all Power? So that at the ſame time, that he flatters <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13. by telling him, neither King nor People are Judges of his ſucceſſion, he had before given the People of <hi>France</hi> a power of altering the right of ſucceſſion, without doing any wrong to his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14, who now rules; for he was <hi>res non exiſtens</hi> when he wrote this book <hi>De jure belli &amp; pacis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometime neither as <hi>Hogan Mogan,</hi> nor ſtipendary to <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Bodin,</hi> in the laſt Chapter of his <hi>Republique,</hi> becauſe neither from <hi>Plato's</hi> nor <hi>Xenophon's</hi> opinion, he can find Juſtice to conſiſt in Geometrical nor Arithmetical proportion, will therefore have it to conſiſt in Harmonical; he not underſtanding harmonical proportion: For he makes it conſiſt in four terms, <hi>viz.</hi> 4. 6. 8. 12. and what proportion 4. has to 6. he ſuppoſes <hi>Lex</hi> to have to <hi>Aequitas;</hi> and what proportion 8. has to 12. (which is the ſame with 4. to 6.) has <hi>Legis actio,</hi> to <hi>Judicis officium;</hi> and what proportion 4. has to 8. has the Law, to the action of the Law; and what proportion 6. has to 12. (which is the ſame with 4. to 8. <hi>viz.</hi> double) has Equity, to the office of the Judge.</p>
                  <p>He has indeed taken four numbers, out of which Arithmetical and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:200520:58"/> Harmonical proportion may be taken; as 4. 8. 12. is in Arithmetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and 6. 8. 12. is in Harmonical; but 4. 6. 8. 12. is in Geometrical proportion. Harmonical proportion is, when three numbers are ſo ordained, that the proportion of the greateſt number to the leaſt, is the ſame with the differences between the two greater, and the two leſſer: As in theſe three numbers, 6. 8. 12. the proportion between 12. the greateſt number, and 6. the leaſt number, is double; and the difference between 12. and 8. the greater numbers, is 4. and between 8. and 6. the leſſer numbers, is 2. and 4. is the double of 2. And therefore 6. 8. 12. are in Harmonical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. 8. to 6. is <hi>in proportione ſeſquitertia</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">It ſelf and a third part; for 4. is 3. and a third part of 3.</note>, which makes <hi>Diateſſaron.</hi> or a fourth Note in Muſick. 12. to 8. is <hi>in proportione ſeſquialtera</hi>

                  <p>To what a condition here would theſe men reduce Mankind! For, what a condition are men in, where there are no Laws? To what purpoſe are Laws, where there are not they who may bear rule? <hi>Parum eſt niſi ſunt qui poſsint jura gerere.</hi> And who would look for Rulers out of theſe mens Writings? where men muſt cut one anothers throats, to find them; and when they are found, then muſt men ſubject themſelves to them, either body and ſoul actively, and not paſſively only, that is, ſuffer, when in their conſciences they dare not act; or elſe to obey ſo long as the fickle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant Multitude will pretend a neceſſity of rebelling or reſiſting, or judge it rational to reſiſt and depoſe; and ſo to the old trade of cutting throats again: Whether this thing, or that thing? this man, or that man be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme? And after all this ſhall the poor Hobnail be no wiſer, nor in any better, but much worſe condition then he was before.</p>
                  <p>It is rarely ſeen, that where men are not content with thoſe Heirs <note place="margin">See Sir <hi>Edw. Coke Inſtit.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 35, 36.</note> which God gives them, that God does bleſs thoſe men which are put in the place of ſuch Heirs. But without all queſtion, where Subjects are not content with what Soveraign God gives them, God did ſcarce ever bleſs any ſuch as they made to themſelves. And let any ſober man conſider, into what a miſerable condition ſuch Subjects or People have brought themſelves: For they muſt needs live in continual fear, leſt the true Heir ſhould recover his right againſt him whom they have ſet up. But ſuppoſe that there be no fear that ever the right Heir ſhould come into his place; yet they have given a preſident to all Poſterity, not to ſubmit to this whom they have ſet up: For why in reaſon ſhould Poſterity be obliged to obey this, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they were not bound to obey the right Heir? Neither was Subjects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition under Monarchy ever ſo bad, but the endeavoring to reform it by force of Arms, has made it much worſe. The examples of this are infinite. It is uſual therefore, where Subjects have taken up Arms and depoſed Government, to alter the <hi>Species</hi> of their Government. For this, if the Government be converted from <hi>Monarchy</hi> into any other, See Mr. <hi>Hobbs Annotation</hi> upon the 3. <hi>Article</hi> of the 10. <hi>Chap. De Cive.</hi>

                  <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
                  <head type="sub">The Obſervators charge againſt his Adverſaries grounds and ſuperſtructure, wherein they all agree.</head>
                  <p>SInce there is ſo little harmony between theſe Three in their ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, not only to one another, but alſo to themſelves; it would make any man ſuſpect, if there were nothing elſe, that their grounds were falſe. We will therefore, before we ſtate our own principles and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure, ſet down theirs, and ſhew wherein they all agree, and wherein we differ. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Herein do all my three Adverſaries and I differ: They all ſay, that by Nature all men are in a like equal condition, and out of ſociety, until by voluntary pacts and acts of their will they ſhall have formed themſelves into ſociety. I ſay, that men are by Nature born into ſociety and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. To warrant this, I have not only the conſent of the preſent Age, but the conſtant practice of all Ages in the world, from the teſtimonies of all Prophane and Sacred Hiſtory; and that not only ſince the Flood, but before, if God made <hi>Adam</hi> an univerſal Monarch, as well over his wife and children, as over all other creatures; and that that there was a conſtant ſucceſſion of the Patriarchs in the Firſt-born, from <hi>Seth</hi> to <hi>Noah.</hi> Whereas none of them can give teſtimony of one man in the world that ever lived out of Society, or tell when, or who firſt violated Nature ſo as to introduce it; and from whence it hath ever ſince continued all over the world, againſt the right of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſay, All power in Government was originally in the People. I ſay, that for above three thouſand years after the Creation (excepting the <hi>Locedemonian</hi> Duarchy) was no Government but only Monarchy; nor was there any of them derived from the People: And that whereſoever ſince the Creation, the People did aſſume to themſelves the Supremacy, they did it by unjuſt uſurpation. Beſide Nature, I have almoſt infinite places in Sacred Writ to warrant that all Supreme power is from God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; They, no colour of any one.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They making men by Nature to be out of ſociety, and by acts of their wills to be in ſociety, make Nature to be depending and ſubſervient to the wills of men; whereas Natural cauſes do immediately proceed from God, and are above the will of man. Society therefore being natural, the actions of the wills of the moſt perverſe and wicked men in the world could never make them out of ſociety; but where they would not be commanded by their rightful Superiors, fell a commanding and obeying among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They all not only invert Nature, and make Wills and Pacts ſuperior to it in the cauſe of Society; but all of them make the natural relations of rightful Princes and Subjects to be diſſolvible by the wills of men; yet after a different manner. <hi>Grotius,</hi> when there is a neceſſity, makes them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvible by the Subjects: Our Author, when the Subjects judge it reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: And <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> when the King or <hi>Civitas</hi> will give or ſell the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Whereas Regal power being Gods ordinance, is therefore ſuperior to mens wills, and cannot be aliened or diſſolved by the will of man.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:200520:59"/> 5. They all not only invert Nature, and make it alterable by the will of man, but make the Law of Nature, or God, to take its origination from the civil pact or will of man; whereas the Law of Nature is eternal and immutable by the will of man, and connatural with every man, and always had, and ever ſhall have a like obligation upon all men in all ages and places.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I ſay, They not only blaſphemouſly make Nature and the Law of God alienable, and depending upon the will of man; but alſo moſt illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically confound the relations of agencie and patiencie in the ſame ſubject, and make the <hi>Cives</hi> to conſtitute the civil pact, and to be ſubject to it; whereas <hi>Omnis potentia activa eſt principium tranſmutandi aliud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. They invert Grammatical conſtruction, in making the <hi>Cives</hi> who conſtitute the <hi>Civitas,</hi> the patient or governed; and the <hi>Civitas</hi> who accepts the wills of the <hi>Cives,</hi> to be the agent or governor: Whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is true in both; for, <hi>Obligans</hi> is the governor who does will, and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatus</hi> the governed who accepts the will of the governor.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They all moſt ridiculouſly make the Creature, the <hi>Civitas,</hi> ſuperior to, and the Governor of the Creator, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Cives;</hi> whereas it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible any Being ſhould be prime or ſuperior to the cauſe of its being.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They all of them make the <hi>Cives</hi> to endue the <hi>Civitas</hi> with that which none of them have either ſeparately or conjunctly, <hi>viz.</hi> a power of life and death, and creating property; whereas <hi>Nil dat quod non habet, &amp; nemo poteſt transferre id in alium quod ipſe non habet.</hi> If all theſe things be true, and that I have not unjuſtly charged them in my <hi>Obſervations,</hi> how contrary they are not only to one another, but to themſelves in their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure; then let the world judge, eſpecially you my dear and native Countrymen, whether grounds ſo unnatural, ſo blaſphemous, ſo illogical, ſo contrary to common ſenſe and grammatical conſtruction, ſo ridiculous and impoſſible, ſhould be worthy to be accounted the Principles of Humane ſociety: Or whether they ought not to be exploded by mankind, as fit for nothing but to abuſe ignorant men, and to open a gap for Sedition and Atheiſm. If I have here, or heretofore unjuſtly charged them, two of my Adverſaries are alive, and of age, and may anſwer for themſelves; and no queſtion but <hi>Grotius</hi> hath followers enough who may vindicate him, if he hath wrong done him. Or if I have committed any of theſe things, in theſe <hi>Elements,</hi> let them make it appear, I will thank them for it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ans thoughts of Life, and Living, are odd things, pritty Antitheſes, he thinks his whole Life (though he ſhould live a Thouſand years) too ſhort; and yet every day, nay hour of his living, too long. Vicious Men therefore miſplace their happineſs, in entertaining worldly pleaſures, thereby to delude, and ſpend their time, which they deſire ſo much to continue in their Life, that in their living, it might not ſeem to be. Virtuous Men have the ſame thoughts of Life and living with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Men, but their actions diſcern them: For thoſe hours, which in their Life would otherwiſe ſeem tedious to them, they entertain either in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of God, or his Works; or by doing virtuouſly, ſweeten thoſe ſowre effects, which idleneſs cauſes: So that the old Philoſophers would affirm,
<pb facs="tcp:200520:62"/> That not Years but Virtue ſhould be the meaſure of Mans life. And this reward hath God (the Author of Virtue in Men, as <hi>Plato</hi> divinely affirms) given <note place="margin">Meno: prope finem.</note> to virtuous Men, that they not onely take pleaſure in remembring time paſt, but alſo hope well in time to come, notwithſtanding all the frowns of perverſe and wrinckled Fortune; whereas vicious Men are onely pleaſed with deceiving the preſent time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to look back upon their actions paſt, and affrighted upon the apprehenſions of death, and worldly calamities which (notwithſtanding all their <hi>Proteus</hi> ſhapes and <hi>Janus</hi> faces) happens to them, as well as virtuous Men, in time to come.</p>
                  <p>There is no time wherein virtuous Men may not contemplate God either as God, or in his Works, or do well; whereas many times vicious Men (though never ſo rich and able to maintain their Vices) are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wearied with them, or have not means to attain to what they call the fruition of them; and then they may be truly accounted miſerable, becauſe they know not what to do, and are neither pleaſed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of what is paſt, nor can hope well in time to come. And indeed, no Man is ſo miſerable as he who knows not how to entertain a day, but by being vicious in it. Vicious Men deſire that all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be buried in oblivion with them, and will make it a cauſe of quarrel for any Man to mention thoſe things they daily do as their actions; whereas it is onely Virtue that does eterniſe Men to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for the whole Earth is a Monument for famous Men, and their Virtues ſhall not onely be teſtified by inſcription of Stone at home, but by an unwritten
<pb facs="tcp:200520:62"/> Record of the Minde, which more then any Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will remain with every one for ever.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> in his Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, compares Times to Ways, whereof ſome are more uphil and downhil, ſome are more plain and even; the one is better for the Reader, the other for the Liver: Sometime it pleaſes God that Virtue ſhould be (as it were) ſo in faſhion, That to be virtuous, is commendable, and rewarded; other while, Virtue is not onely perſecuted by all the contrary names, but virtuous Men are butchered, impriſoned, ſequeſtred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for no other cauſe but onely their Virtue. <hi>Tacitus</hi> accounteth it a rare felicity of the Times, whenas an Hiſtorian may without danger Record the Hiſtory of the Times.</p>

                     <hi>Polybius</hi> affirmeth of truth, That ſhe ought to be <note place="margin">Proem Hiſt.</note> eſteemed of Men as the greateſt Goddeſs, and that the greateſt Power ought to be attributed to her: For though all Men oppoſe her, and ſometime many kinds of veriſimilitudes and appearances ſtand againſt her for a Lie; yet I know not how, ſhe by her ſelf inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates her ſelf into the mindes of Men: And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time on the ſudden ſhews how potent ſhe is; and ſometime after ſhe hath been along time obſcured by darkneſs, at length of her ſelf prevails, and expugn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lie. If a Man vary the terms of Truth and Lie, into Virtue and Vice, this affirmation will not leſs hold true. Virtue was never ſo oppreſſed by Ignorance and Faction, but that the virtues of good Men ſhall finde honorable mention afterward: And Vice and Faction, however cryed up at preſent, ſhall hereafter be fully laid open, and their deformity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb facs="tcp:200520:63"/> to all Poſterity. Virtue is the ſame in all Ages, and moſt amiable in her ſimple nakedneſs: and it is Vice which hath need of falſe gloſſes, and hath ſuch ſpecious ſhewes and pretences put upon it, to make it ſeem Virtue, which fucous and falſe paint continues no longer then the preſent Faction.</p>
                  <p>Of all Virtues next after Religion, Juſtice is the moſt worthily ranged in the firſt place, not only as including all other Virtues, but as excluding it all a Mans actions are rendred as Vile and contemptible, other Vices are like Moats in running waters, (and the ſmalleſt Moats are eaſileſt ſeen in pureſt ſtreams) but injuſtice is like the poyſoning the Fountain, which corrupts all the ſtream. There is no Man that is ſo perfect, but ſome ſpots and ſtains may be ſpied in his actions, which are ſooneſt ſpied in the beſt Men; but no Man (Heathen or Chriſtian) can deſerve the leaſt reputation of being good or Virtuous, who is an unjuſt Man. It was not <hi>Alexanders</hi> Venery, Ryot, Drunkenneſs, and Captivity to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Effeminacy (Vices though bad enough) but his <hi>occidit etiam Calliſthenem,</hi> that was put in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiz <note place="margin">Senec. de be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiis.</note> to all his Virtues. It is Juſtice, which (next after the moſt immortal, greateſt beſt God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) fabricates, connects and eſtabliſheth Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdoms in Unity and Peace. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice which (next after Gods puniſhments for their ſins) ſubverts them to the ruine of the greateſt part of the inhabitants; ſo that Juſtice deſervedly hath the pre-eminence of Virtues next after Religion, and Injuſtice is the fouleſt and vileſt of all Vices, after Atheiſme.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:200520:63"/>
                  <p> Though Juſtice be ſo high and noble a Virtue, yet I think there was never any thing by learned Men (as <hi>Xenophon, Plato, Ariſtotle, Bodin, Grotius)</hi> more miſtaken. Not that I deny but that many Virtuous Men from their innate good nature, have in their actions practiſed that, which hath been rarely well defined; like Men who by a habit ſpeak well, yet cannot give a Grammatical conſtruction of their ſpeech; or like the <hi>Romans,</hi> who though the <hi>Grecians</hi> were beſt at the Theory of Rhetorick and Poetry, were the beſt Orators and Poets; or like the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who in blood-letting ſuppoſed the circulation of the blood, yet none aſſerted it before the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Philoſopher Doctor <hi>William Harvey;</hi> or like a Muſitian, who compoſes well, yet underſtands but little in the Theory of Muſick.</p>
                  <p>For my part, as I hate Flattery as one of the baſeſt Vices, and the moſt inconſiſtent with Ingenuity, or Integrity, ſo had I much rather that theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, though a preſent ſufferer for them, then by any ſiniſter means to attain to any greatneſs whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>All things are at firſt appearance, curiouſly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and cenſured by Men, it may be moſt by them, who leaſt underſtand them; for, <hi>Nihil eſt facilius quam reprehendere alium.</hi> I deſire nothing elſe of any ingenuous Reader, then that in cenſuring any thing in this following diſcourſe, he would declare what he would have inſtead of it.</p>

But ſuppoſe all Men are by nature equal, and yet have a right to create a ſupream Power, which may give Property, yet then it muſt follow, That all the Men of the World muſt be ſubject to one Individual Government: For <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Greece</hi> have as much right to all the things in <hi>Britain,</hi> as the Inhabitants of <hi>Britain</hi> have; and the Men of <hi>Spain</hi> have as much right to all the things in <hi>Italy,</hi> as the <hi>Italians</hi> have; and ſo have the <hi>French</hi> to all things in <hi>Italy, Germany, Perſia, &amp;c.</hi> Nor can the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>France, Germany, Spain, &amp;c.</hi> frame to themſelves any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for <hi>ex hypotheſi</hi> by the Law of Nature, the <hi>Perſians, Indians, Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites, &amp;c.</hi> have as much right in <hi>France, Germany, Spain, &amp;c.</hi> as the <hi>French, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> have.

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:200520:65"/>
                  <p> Nor is that Fancie leſs groundleſs, which ſuppoſeth that Regal power or government was firſt inſtituted from an aggregation or conſent of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: For how is it poſſible there ſhould be a Family, where there is no Supreme power which gave Property, in that place and habitation where that Family is? Nor where there is no Law precedent obliging, can it be expected that any man will (where he may be free at his own pleaſure) be a Servant: Nor can it in reaſon be ſuppoſed, that any man will contract with another to be his Servant, whereas he may as well expect to be his Maſter. It ſhall be therefore our endevour to find out the true Cauſes and Principles of Power and Subjection. But before we proceed, it will not be amiſs to ſee, in a ſhort view, the natural difference between Man and other Creatures of this inferior orb; and why Humane or Politick Government is only neceſſary to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Creatures of this inferior orb, only Man uſes Reaſon; by which with the help of his Memory and Experience, he proceeds from things manifeſt and known to the Underſtanding, to find out things leſs known, and more obſcure: yet ſtill ſo, that ſubſequent Generations may infinitely adde to what precedent Ages had found out; whereas other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do by an impulſe of Nature (being taught of no Creature, nor from any obſervation by themſelves) inſite and connatural with them, at firſt attain to ſuch perfection, that in ſucceſſion of time nothing is added to it. Thus we ſee all Birds at their firſt trial make their neſts with as much art and ingenuity, as thoſe that do live longeſt; And ſo the younger Bees make the honicomb as perfect as thoſe who had done it twice or thrice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And certainly it is an admirable thing to conſider, with how great providence theſe ſmalleſt Creatures and imperfect Animals do chooſe out places for their conceptions, even before they be living creatures, and but only ſo in power; and with what unimitable art they build, fortifie, and hide the place wherein they repoſe them. I have ſeen an <hi>Indian</hi> Birds neſt, which was made upon a ſmall bough growing over waters, which bough was too weak to ſupport the weight of a Monky, (the Monkies in thoſe parts of <hi>India</hi> uſe to prey upon young Birds) and provident Nature points out theſe places to thoſe Birds for the ſecurity of their young ones from the Monkies; for of all terreſtrial creatures, only Men and Monkies, and their kindes, ſwim not naturally; and the Monky, if he in ſeeking to get the young birds, falls into the water, drowns himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I have with great admiration ſeen Frogs (which are uſually generated in the moneth of <hi>March)</hi> confidently and careleſly ſwimming croaking upon one another upon the ſurface of the water, whenas Horſes and other cattel have been there; but upon the coming of Ducks (who naturally prey upon and devour them) they have been all huſht and gone, and not one to be ſeen: It being ſure worthy admiration, that Providence ſhould ſo direct thoſe ſpurious and imperfect animals, and but of yeſterdays being, and not of much longer continuance, to know without any apprehenſion of danger thoſe creatures who are not hurtful to them, and to fear and avoid thoſe who are enemies and prey upon them. Neither is Providence leſs ſeen in all creatures (if a man conſiders it) in the preſervation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their young ones; ſo that a man muſt needs confeſs, that in them is ſome particle of Divine air, and this their unlearned art and wiſdom is rather to be admired their imitated by us.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:200520:65"/>
                  <p> Man by his obſervation and experience findes out what things and Creatures are hurtful or helpful to him; other Creatures by an inſtinct of Nature, at the firſt ſight know what things and Creatures are hurtful to them or not: thus we ſee the timerous young Hare feedes ſecurely among Horſes and Cowes, and the oldeſt Hart flyes afrighted from the ſmalleſt dogge. Man can never attain to the knowledge of what things conduce moſt for his corporal preſervation (and therefore the oldeſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced and learned Phyſitian may to morrow find what the day before he was ignorant of; and yet ſhall never attain to the perfection of knowing what is beſt for his own body) which other Creatures (by avoiding thoſe things which are hurtful, and chooſing thoſe things which are moſt benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for themſelves) do.</p>
                  <p>The careful Navigator by the help of ſome Theorems of longitude and latitude, and the uſe of his Card and Compaſſe, ſailes from one Coaſt to another, whereas other Creatures by a propenſe diſpoſition to this or that place, without any obſervations and direction of their ſenſes, fly to other regions where they never were before. So Faulcons, Wildgeeſe, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, &amp;c. come from other regions into <hi>England</hi> in the Autumn, and at the Spring forſake us. And Swallowes; Martyns, Hobbyes, &amp;c. which brood with us in the Summer, when the Antumn approaches, leave this Clymate for another, to which they cannot attain by any ſenſe or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their own. A Gentleman living in <hi>Buckingham-</hi>ſhire had a Beagle ſent him by Sea from the moſt Eaſtern part of <hi>Suffolk</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and from thence was conveyed by water into <hi>Buckingham-</hi>ſhire: ſome time after, upon ſome diſtaſte taken by the dogg, he returned home to his old Maſter by land, which was above an hundred miles: But what is moſt admirable is, that <hi>omne genus Balaenae,</hi> as Dolphins, Whales, Porpices (which do not keep in ſhoales or company; and although Fiſhes are <hi>animalia vivipara,</hi> that is, bringing forth their young ones actual living Creatures, and do generate <hi>viviparorum more)</hi> ſhould in that vaſt body of the Ocean (when as by reaſon of the groſſeneſs of the <hi>Medium,</hi> they cannot uſe their ſight at any ſmall diſtance, to perceive when they are neer one another) at the ſeaſons of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration find one another. To proceed herein, were proper for <hi>Plinies</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtory, or <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Hiſtory of living Creatures.</p>
                  <p>All Creatures are either <hi>animalia nociva,</hi> hurtful Creatures, which prey upon, and devoure other living Creatures; or <hi>innocua,</hi> which feed and eate upon ſuch vegetives as grow and are renewed by the earth or water; or <hi>ſociabilia,</hi> which are only Men who are better or worſe then other living Creatures accidentally. If they ſuffer themſelves to be enſlaved by their depraved paſſions and appetitions, then they become worſe than any hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creature; but if they (by depreſſing their paſſions and ill affections) rule their actions by reaſon, they far tranſcend all other Creatures.</p>
                  <p>The end of Government is twofold, either to preſerve the governed in peace within themſelves, or to protect them from forraign force or power; in neither of which reſpects is Government requiſite to other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures beſides Men: For <hi>animalia nociva</hi> are <hi>ſolivaga,</hi> and therefore no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is required to keep them in Peace one with another, whereas they do not company one with another. And many other living Creatures who are not by nature hurtful, do not keep in companies, and therefore no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to preſerve themſelves in peace, is requiſite to them neither. It is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:200520:66"/> an admirable thing to contemplate how nature has granted to theſe hurtful and robuſtious Creatures, armes conſentaneous to their force, to protect themſelves from outward force and violence of thoſe Creatures who are enemies unto them; as the Lyon his paws and tayle, the Bear his paw, the Fox, Otter, Brock, &amp;c. their Teeth; whereas other Creatures who are by nature denied thoſe armes to defend themſelves, what a ſtrange cunning and dexterity has nature given them in the preſervation of themſelves, from thoſe Creatures who are hurtful to them, and prey upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Creatures who live in Community one with another, by deſiring the ſame things, and avoiding the ſame things, to direct their actions to a common end, that their companies are obnoxious to no ſeditions; and therefore Government is not neceſſary to them neither, and of them is Man uſually Protector againſt their ravening enemies.</p>
                  <p>Men differ from other Creatures, for they are neither <hi>Animalia ſolivaga,</hi> not <hi>gregalia,</hi> but <hi>ſociabilia,</hi> that is, living in converſation and ſubordination; and Man is born a living Creature, apted potentially for ſociety, and alike naked and unarmed as one whom nature intended a ſociable, peaceful, and politick Creature, and to be governed rather by reaſon, than force in all his actions; and therefore has endewed him with hands and ingenuity, that having by his ingenuity purchaſed himſelf neceſſaries, he might with his hands cloathe, feed, and defend himſelf.</p>
                  <p>In all other Creatures the Laws of Nature (that is, thoſe bounds which God by Nature has ſet them) are ſecurely obeyed and never tranſgreſſed by them, and are only tranſgreſſed and violated by Man; and therefore the Laws of Nature are not ſufficient for the preſervation of mankind in Peace; for by reaſon of the diſcords which ariſe naturally in Men, for Honor and preheminence. Secondly the appetite of poſſeſſing all things. Thirdly the deſire to excell other Men in wiſdome and policy, and to that end are ſtudious of novelty which cauſes ſeditions and civil warrs, that they might be eſteemed wiſer then the men of this preſent Age, or their predeceſſors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reaſon of which, preſent coerſive humane Laws are neceſſary for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving peace among Men, that the feare of a preſent puniſhment may deter men from thoſe things, which becauſe of their Infidelity and Atheiſme they otherwiſe would not feare.</p>
                  <p>Iſay, this Humane Power, from whence all Humane Laws are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is from the Law of Nature, and if it ſhall ſeem ſtrange to any Man that it ſhould be Humane, and yet derived from the Law of Nature; let that Man conſider that only Man is a Humane Creature, and does Humane and reaſonable actions; and yet it is from the Law of Nature, that only Man is a Humane Creature and can do Humane and reaſonable actions. And the Fathers and Husbands power is Humane; yet I think no Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> did ever deny, that they were from the Law of Nature. I know in uſual ſpeech the ſupream power of Nations, is called Politick power, which is a miſtaking of the cauſe for the effect, for it is not the power which is politick in the cauſe, but in the effect and exerciſe; as take an inſtance of my meaning, A Father hath divers Children of ſeveral diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, one diſpoſed to learning, another endewed with bodily ſtrength, and averſe from learning; another hath not bodily ſtrength, yet a deſire to learning: but by reaſon of his groſs <hi>Minerva,</hi> is not probably qualified to attain to any great progreſs in it, &amp;c. The Father breeds up his Studious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:200520:66"/> Son in literature, his Active Son which hath no diſpoſition to learning he makes a Soldier, or Seaman; his Duller Child he binds an Apprentice to ſome Trade, &amp;c. Though the Fathers power be Natural, yet this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it is Politick; ſo though Regal Power be from the Law of Nature; yet muſt the exerciſe of it be Politick. And therefore Humane Laws, and the exerciſe or Politick uſe of Humane Power, cannot (though the Power of all Kings be alike, and from the Law of Nature) be the ſame in ſeveral Nations, but different according to the nature, manners, and diſpoſitions of the Inhabitants. And we ſee the ſame King governing in divers places, by divers Laws, accordingly as his Subjects are different in manners, and diſpoſitions. Humane Laws therefore, and the Politick uſe of Regal Power; cannot be as the Laws of Nature are immutable, and the ſame in all parts of the world, but ought to take their origination from the nature and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Governed, and are alterable as Mens vices and manners do alter.</p>

Virtue being by the definition, the Dictate of Right reaſon from <note place="margin">From whence Theological virtue is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</note> ſome ſuperior cauſe or notion; Theological virtue is a Dictate of Right reaſon, from ſome revelation of God in the Scriptures, which otherwiſe had been impoſſible for any man by the light of humane nature to have attained to. By Theological virtues I do not mean only thoſe three moſt eminent virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity, but all thoſe actions of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due to them who have overſight of me in the Lord, as a Chriſtian; and to whom I owe my obedience not by any Law of Nature, but as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God in the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Moral Virtues are thoſe Dictates of Right reaſon which flow from <note place="margin">What are Moral vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and from whence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.

                        <p n="6">6. Humane Virtues are thoſe Dictates of Right reaſon, by which Subjects, Wives and Children, conform their actions to the Laws or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Supreme powers, Husbands and Parents.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Familiſtical Virtues, are thoſe actions of Servants done in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the commands of the Maſters of Families.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Perſonal Virtues, are thoſe actions (which are dictated to divers men from principles of innate good nature) of Temperance, Continency, Patience, Liberality and Frugality; whoſe contrary extremes are vices and ſins.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Prudential Virtues are not dictated from any Divine or Humane <note place="margin">What are Prudential virtues, and from whence derived.</note> Laws; but from ſome Principles known to the underſtanding (which are more or leſs, as men are more or leſs intelligible) whereby ſome Princes govern more prudently then others, and ſome Maſters of families govern their ſervants more prudently then others. And theſe Virtues have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference only to the government of Men, but to other actions; as Prudence in managing of an Eſtate, is a Virtue; or in mens governing their actions, ſo that they are eſteemed, and not deſpiſed by other men, are Virtues: yet theſe actions are no where commanded, or forbidden by any Divine or Humane Laws. Theſe Virtues are always placed in Empire, not in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. God having made Man a rational creature, and endued him with <note place="margin">The <hi>ratio fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis</hi> of all virtues, and how they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Firſt of Theological virtues.</note> an immortal Soul, capable of eternal happineſs, hath revealed himſelf ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally in the Scriptures to Men as reaſonable creatures; ſo that they directing their actions conformable to his precepts therein contained, might by faith or believing on him hope for eternal happineſs.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. The end of all Moral Virtue is, that men may preſerve peace and <note place="margin">The end of Morality.</note> ſociety, ſo long as they live in this world: And God hath made Man a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable creature, as well as intellectual and rational; and therefore hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven theſe eternal and immutable Laws of Nature in the minds of all mortal men, that by conforming their actions thereunto, they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:200520:71"/> peace and ſociety with men. And though theſe of themſelves are not ſufficient to pully man up to eternal happineſs; yet let no man hope, that deſpiſing theſe Laws of the great God of Nature, upon a pretended Faith he ſhall ever attain it.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. But becauſe the Law of Nature does oftentimes command <hi>in Theſi</hi>

So though Moral virtues be always the ſame, yet Humane virtues differ, accordingly as Laws in divers places are different. Thus it is a Moral virtue in Wives and Children, to honor and obey their Husbands and Parents; but as a Humane virtue, the doing of ſuch a thing may be Virtue at one time, and Vice at another, as it is commanded or forbidden by the Husband or Parents. So that Humane virtues in Subjects, Wives and Children, are neceſſary to the conſervation of ſociety, where the laws or principles of ſuch actions are not plainly repugnant to Divine laws.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. The end of all Familiſtical virtue is, that Servants by all juſt and <note place="margin">The end of Familiſtical virtues.</note> lawful means intend the good of their Maſters, and make no diſſentions or diſcontents in their Families.</p>

But Gods negative precepts do not only always oblige, but oblige <hi>ad ſemper</hi> too; for there is no time at all wherein it is lawful for a man to <hi>kill,</hi> to <hi>ſteal,</hi> to <hi>commit adultery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. negative in all inſtances.</p>

                        <p n="5">5. Eccleſiaſtical laws, according to the uſage and cuſtom of <hi>England,</hi>

It is true, no queſtion but that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally not only all Biſhopricks, and their bounds, and the diviſion of all Pariſhes, and the conuſance the Church hath of Tythes, of Probate of Wills, of granting of Letters of Adminiſtration, and Accounts upon the ſame, the right of Inſtitution and Induction, and the erection of all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Courts, &amp;c. were all originally of the Kings foundation and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and that to him only, by all divine and humane laws, belongs the care and preſervation of all his Subjects, none excepted, in all cauſes: And therefore not only all thoſe things which relate to the extern peace and quiet of the Church, although exerciſed by Eccleſiaſtical perſons, but all thoſe priviledges and immunities which the Church or Churchmen have in a Church planted, which the Primitive Chriſtians and Apoſtles had not, in the perſecution of the Church when planting, are originally Grants of Kings and Supreme Powers, and ſo Temporal or Secular Laws; but in regard they accidentally have reference to the Church, and are exerciſed by Eccleſiaſtical perſons, they are not improperly called the Kings Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Laws. And ſure either ignorance of this, or faction, hath made men run into two contrary extremes: one, That Kings have no right to their Crowns, but <hi>in ordine ad bonum ſpirituale,</hi> and ſo cannot be Kings: or, That all power and juriſdiction in all cauſes is from the King; and ſo cannot there be any ſuch thing as Chriſtian faith, Religion, or any Ghoſtly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:200520:75"/> power left by our Saviour with his Church, to continue to the end of the world; which every Chriſtian man <hi>de fide</hi> ought to believe, and ſubmit to, before any Temporal Law or Power in the world.</p>

But let that man have a care that he have not the ſpirit of pride in him, which he pretends to be Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for an evil Conſcience ſhall never juſtifie any man for his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; nor ſhall ever any mans hating of Idols, excuſe his committing of Sacrilege. And let no man hope that his fancying ſome errors in a Church, does give him a liberty of putting himſelf out of the communion and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Church, and ſetting up of himſelf in ſtead of it. No Chriſtian man can hope for ſalvation, but as he is a Member of Chriſts Church; nor ought any Chriſtian man to hope, that any Heathen man can be ſaved in the ordinary way of ſalvation; <hi>For there is no name under heaven by which a man can be ſaved, but only by the name of Jeſus:</hi> And, <hi>He that obeys not the Church, is to be accounted as a Heathen man,</hi> S. Mat. 18. 17.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Temporal or Secular laws oblige not only in Conſcience, but alſo <note place="margin">The obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws.</note> to temporal puniſhments. That they inflict temporal puniſhments, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent every where in the world, as well for ſpiritual, as temporal crimes. Thus did <hi>Phineas</hi> turn away Gods wrath from the children of Iſrael, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 11. So did <hi>Joſhuah</hi> for <hi>Achans</hi> ſacrilege, (that is, ſtealing or converting to common or prophane uſes, what is dedicated and offered up to God) attone and pacify Gods wrath by ſtoning <hi>Achan</hi> to death. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 7. So did <hi>Solomon</hi> put <hi>Shimei</hi> to death by <hi>Davids</hi> will, becauſe he curſed Gods Anointed and his Soveraign, which was a ſpiritual crime. And God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the temporal powers not to ſuffer a Witch to live, and Witch-craft is a ſpiritual crime. And that temporal laws do oblige aſwell in conſcience, as inflict corporal pecumary mulcts, is evident <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> And the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of, is to temporal powers.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. VII. Of Promiſes, Contracts, &amp;c.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. A Promiſe is the giving of a Mans Faith unto another, that he will <note place="margin">A Promiſe.</note> do or give, or not do or give ſuch a thing, <hi>fidem do me daturum vel preſtiturum, aut non;</hi> or <hi>dabo,</hi> or <hi>faciam,</hi> or <hi>non dabo</hi> or <hi>faciam,</hi> is a promiſe, and to the performance of his promiſe is every Man obliged by the Law of Nature.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But when the Declaration of my will does not evade into Faith given, my</hi>

                           <hi>will being free continues free, after ſuch declaration, as well as before. As if I ſay,</hi> volo dare vel facere, <hi>I will or intend to do or give ſuch a thing, yet when I will I may will to do ſuch a thing, and therefore if a Man make twenty Wills, yet when be will, he may unwill them all. So if a Man upon things appearing reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, does will to give or do any thing, yet if upon diſcourſe or reaſoning it ſhall appear that the giving or doing ſuch a thing will not have ſuch an event as he propoſed, he may chooſe whether he will give or do that thing: nay, if he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the doing of ſuch an act, will not have ſuch an effect as he propoſed, and ſhall notwithſtanding do it, this is the act of a wilful and not a prudent Man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. A Vow is when one plights his Faith to God, that he will give <note place="margin">A Vow.</note> to God, or a Creature ſuch a thing. All Promiſes and Vowes are either made by words in the future tenſe, as <hi>dabo,</hi> or <hi>faciam:</hi> or by words in the preſent tenſe, as <hi>fidem do;</hi> but then the <hi>habendum, preſtandum</hi> or <hi>faciendum,</hi> is alwaies in the futuretenſe, as <hi>fidem do me daturum vel facturum,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. A Contract or Pact is the conditional act of two or more mutually <note place="margin">A Contract or Pact.</note> promiſing one another to give one another ſomething in exchange, or when two or more mutually promiſe one another, that if one will do or give ſuch a thing, that then the other will do or give ſuch a thing, upon the doing or giving of one part, the other is by Law obliged to performe his promiſe: or upon the giving or receiving any part of what is contracted for, both parties are obliged to performe their contract: As if I contract with another to give him ten pounds for a horſe, and give him ſix pence, or more or leſs (this being an outward expreſs ſign of the contract) both parties are obliged, the one to pay the reſidue of the mony, and the other to deliver the horſe: or upon the payment, or delivery of the horſe by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:200520:76"/> one party, the Law obligeth the other to the performance of his promiſe. So if I promiſe another to give him five ſhillings, &amp;c. to do ſuch a thing for my ſelf or for another, if the other accepts of any thing in acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he will do that thing, both parties are obliged by the Law; or upon the giving or doing of one party, the Law obligeth the other.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Abſolute promiſes receive their obligation from a precedent, or <note place="margin">Wherein a bare promiſe and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract differ.</note> preſent conſideration or condition; as if for a benefit received, or any preſent conſideration, I promiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Contracts from a ſubſequent, as if I promiſe to another, that if he will do for, or give me or another, ſuch a thing, that then I will do for him or give him ſuch a thing; this being a conditional promiſe or contract, upon the performance of the others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration or conditions, being ſubſequent to my promiſe, I am obliged by Law to performe my promiſe made to him, and therefore <hi>ex nudo pacto non oritur actio,</hi> for I am not obliged by any act of the other to performe any thing. All contracts are made by words of the futuretenſe, as <hi>ſi aliquis dederit aut fecerit, dabo aut faciam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. A contract differs from a meere obligation in this; a ſingle obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <note place="margin">Wherein a Contract differs from a ſingle obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> is, when one or more for ſuch a ſum of Mony, Lands, Houſes, &amp;c. had and received from another, acknowledgeth him or themſelves liable to ſuch a penalty to the other, if they perform not ſuch a condition as is ſpecified in the obligation. A Contract or Pact is, when both or all parts are obliged to performe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>All Promiſes, Vows, Contracts, and Obligations, ought to be only of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Annotat.</note> 
                           <hi>things in poſſeſsion, and that are mens ſo, as by an act of their wills they may be anothers, as they are theirs: and therefore where any man hath a meere right to any thing (this being a ſhadow (another having the ſubſtance) or as our Lawyers ſay,</hi> A choſe in Action) <hi>he cannot by any Contract or otherwiſe alien his right to another, but he can only releaſe it to him in poſſeſsion; otherwiſe the right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtill in him, notwithſtanding any Contract, &amp;c. that he would alien it. And I would gladly be ſatisfied how</hi> Mr. Hobbs <hi>in the generation of his</hi> Civitas. <hi>can make meere rights to be tranferred and aliened by the Pacts of men; and thoſe natural rights too: This being granted,</hi> Mr. Hobbs <hi>may by his Contract with another Man, make himſelf no Man, but a Horſe or an Aſſe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by nature he is a Man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Every Oath is either a calling God to witneſs, that what a Man teſtifies is true or falſe; or elſe a ſpeech added to a promiſe, whereby the <note place="margin">What is an Oath.</note> promiſer does renounce Gods mercy, if he performs not what he promiſes. But if a Man Promiſes, Vows, Contracts, or ſwears to do any thing which is unlawful, he ought not to performe it; for it is ill done to promiſe, &amp;c. but worſe to do any thing unlawful.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. A League is, when two or more do mutually give their faith to <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Foedus</hi> how different from a Pact.</note> obſerve ſuch conditions as are agreed between them, and herein it differs from a Pact or Contract. A Contract or Pact is, when there is a precedent humane Law, obliging the parties contracting to performe all the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſpecified in the contract; A league is, where there is no humane Law obliging but only the Law of Nature. And therefore all ſtipulations made by Princes one with another, are confederacies or leagues, not Contracts or Pacts, becauſe there is no precedent humane Law, obliging them to performe their leagues.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. A Gift is, what I do give to another, ſo as it is mine, <hi>do;</hi> and <note place="margin">Donum.</note>
                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:200520:76"/> though a gift be alwaies in the preſent or preterperfect tenſe, yet the <hi>Haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> may be in the future; as if I make a leaſe freehold, or create a State in taile to one, and grant the reverſion to another and his heires, here though the deed or gift be in the preſenttenſe, yet the reverſion or <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum</hi> is in the future. But no Man can give another any thing, but what depends upon his will, and is his ſo, by ſome poſitive humane law, that by his giving he may ſo make it anothers. For whatſoever is mine by the Law of Nature, cannot be aliened or made anothers by my Will, nor by the Will of all the Men in the world; for it is impoſſible, natural cauſes and relations ſhould be diſſolved by Mans Will.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Feoffment is derived of <hi>foedum</hi> a Fee, <hi>quia eſt donatio foedi,</hi> and this <note place="margin">A Feoffment.</note> is the moſt ancient and neceſſary Conveyance which is uſed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law (that is that Law which concerns tenures and eſtates, uſed only here in <hi>England)</hi> and this deed or conveyance is either of abſolute eſtates of corporeal inheritances, abſolutely paſſed to another by livery and ſeiſin, made according to the intent and purport of ſuch Feoffment (he which conveys ſuch eſtate of inheritance being called the Feoffor, he to whom ſuch inheritance is conveyed, is called the Feoffee) or of abſolute eſtates of inheritance which are not corporeal, as Advouſons, Commons, rents iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of lands which do lye in grant, and do not paſs by livery and ſeiſin, but by delivery of the deed or feoffment.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Do</hi> (or <hi>dedi,</hi> as our Lawyers ſay, which implies a warranty) to <hi>A,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Eſtates-Taile.</note> and his heirs for ever, makes a Feoffment: <hi>Do</hi> or <hi>Dedi,</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> and the heires of his body lawfully begotten, or to <hi>A.</hi> and the heires male or female of his body lawfully begotten; or to <hi>A.</hi> and the heirs male or female on the body of ſuch a Woman, or to a Woman and the Heirs of her body lawfully begotten, or heirs male or female of her body lawfully begotten by ſuch a man, creates a ſtate taile; and he which creates ſuch an eſtate is called Donor, he to whom ſuch eſtate is granted, Donee.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. <hi>Do</hi> or <hi>Dedi</hi> to ſuch a man or woman for term of either of their <note place="margin">Freehold.</note> lives, or to ſuch a man or woman during the life of another, creates a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. <hi>Do</hi> or <hi>Dedi,</hi> or <hi>concedo</hi> or <hi>conceſsi,</hi> to ſuch a man if he ſhall live ſo <note place="margin">Leaſe.</note> long, an eſtate for years, or to ſuch a man and his heirs for ſuch a term, reſerving, or not reſerving ſuch a rent or ſervice, creates a leaſe; In both the latter he who gives is called Leſſor, he who takes, Leſſee; and humane Laws oblige as well to gifts as contracts. For natural Laws oblige in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience only, but men are obliged by mulcts and corporal puniſhments to contracts and gifts. So that in moſt proper ſpeaking, In every gift it is the Law which gives the property to another by an act of the Donors will, and the Donor is the inſtrument by which the Law conveys the property of any gift to another.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Humane Laws therefore obliging men to the performance of <note place="margin">No Law or Legiſlative Right ariſes from any Pact or Contract.</note> their Pacts, Contracts, and Gifts, it is impoſſible they ſhould receive their origination and firſt power from the Pacts and Contracts of Men: For where there is no precedent humane Law obliging, men can neither make Pacts, Contracts, or Gifts, nor have any thing to give and contract for And to ſuppoſe that humane laws muſt precede and oblige men to thei: Contracts and Pacts, and that Contracts and Pacts muſt precede humane laws and give them their power, is moſt manifeſtly abſurd and contradictory.</p>

                     <p n="9">9. Force or Tyranny, is an uſurpation of Command of any Creature, or company of Creatures, not created by any law of God or Man. Nor is it the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of one alone, which makes Tyranny: the very <hi>Grecians</hi> could account the <hi>Athenian Thirty</hi> to be Tyrants; and ſo could the <hi>Romans</hi> the <hi>Decemviri</hi> and <hi>Triumviri.</hi> And no queſtion but it was malice and ſpight, which made the <hi>Grecians</hi> call all Kings Tyrants; and both <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> to make all Kings to be Ravenous creatures. And all thoſe Kings who abuſe their power, are by men uſually called Tyrants, not juſtly. I find no ſuch title given to <hi>Saul, Ahab, Ahaz, Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> but Wicked and Idolatrous, often.

                        <p>Firſt, I ſay, the Law of Nature creates theſe offices of commanding and obeying, upon ſuppoſition of ſome act of the parties commanding and obeying. As Matrimony is the mutual act of the Husband and Wife: I <hi>A. B.</hi> take thee <hi>D. E.</hi> to be my wedded wife; and I <hi>D. E.</hi> take thee <hi>A. B.</hi> to be my wedded Husband: by this act of the Husband and Wife, God by the Law of Nature gives the Husband a power or right of command over the Wife, and ſubjects the Wife to the Husband. Or,</p>
                        <p>Secondly, upon ſuppoſition of ſome act of the parties commanding: As the Parents power ariſing from generation, the Parents muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to generate, before they can have a power or right of command. Or,</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, upon ſuppoſition of no act either of the parties commanding or obeying, as in all rightful Hereditary Monarchies, theſe offices are as much due from the Law of Nature, before any act of the parties command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obeying, as after.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Gods Ordinance to Man being either that Law or Ordinance, <note place="margin">All command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, is not from the Law of Nature.</note> which he has ordinarily engraven in the hearts of Men; or his gracious goodneſs extraordinarily revealed in the Scriptures, and Gods revelation of himſelf by <hi>Moſes</hi> and Prophets, by our Saviour, the Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, was extraordinarily and ſupernaturally given to them by Gods eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace; nor could Men by any natural means attain to the belief of it.

But the offices of commanding and obeying as Maſters and Servants, and Magiſtrates and thoſe ſubject to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:200520:79"/> them, are but temporary, and determinable by the laws of him that made them; therefore not Gods ordinance.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Humane laws create Magiſtrates power two ways: Immediately, <note place="margin">How many ways power and ſubjection happens by humane laws to Magiſtrates and thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them.</note> as when Supreme powers (which are the fountain from whence all Temporal laws are derived) conſtitute any Magiſtrate, giving him juriſdiction over the inhabitants of any place; or when the Laws or Higher powers enable ſuch men to nominate their Magiſtrate, there the Nominators are the inſtruments by which the Law does transfer this Magiſterial power.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. The mutual offices of power and ſubjection between Maſters and <note place="margin">How many ways humane laws create the power and ſubjection of Maſters and Servants.</note> Servants, happen two ways; either created by the contract or pact of the Maſter and Servant, (and we have before ſhewed that all pacts and contracts receive their obligation from Humane laws) as the means by which Humane laws do create theſe offices; or elſe without any pact or contract of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties commanding and obeying, as in the caſes of Slavery where priſoners are taken in war, or men condemned thereunto for ſome offence; or of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſhip, where children are bound for ſuch a term, by the Laws of their Country, or Parents. And I do grant Mr. <hi>Hobbs, Grotius</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> that this power and ſubjection, <hi>Humana voluntas introduxit;</hi> but not the parties obeying, as they moſt ſenſleſly feign, but the Supreme powers or the parties commanding: And where they are not ſo created, all men are ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally free.</p>

I am ſure no ſuch thing, or the leaſt probability thereof appears in Scripture; or that after</hi> Adam's <hi>and</hi> Noah's <hi>deaths, their Poſterities became free and independent from all Government; which was (no body can tell when) brought in by the Pacts of Men, or by conſent and ſubmiſsion of Families to it.</hi>

                        <p n="14">14.

How then can an imaginary rout of Men give a power of life and death, and of creating property (which not any of them, nor all of them together have) to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Humane Laws being the accidents, or effects of Regal Power, they <note place="margin">Regal power not made by Humane laws.</note> cannot be ſuperior to give or create a being to the cauſe; Regal Power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be made or created by Humane Laws.</p>

And if in Regality poſſeſſion alone did create a juſt title, then were <hi>ſumma injuria, ſumma juſtitia;</hi> it being (no queſtion) the higheſt injury to invade the higheſt authority or dominion of another.</p>

                        <p>It is a very remarkable thing, that the Subjects of this Nation (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">Annot.</note> pretending to be Chriſtians) have againſt all rules of Chriſtian Faith, placed all power in Government to be from the people, and their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, to be from their own ſubmiſſion to it; and have by their often forſwearing themſelves to this and that Government, not only habituated themſelves into a belief that there is no ſuch thing as right or power in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but only poſſeſſion; but alſo taken away all Religion and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of an Oath in things lawful and indifferent. God no doubt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it, that they who would not ſtand and be protected by his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and inſtitution, ſhould fall into all infidelity and perjury, and never be true to any thing they ſweare to, and ſet up inſtead of it.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If the Law of God or Nature did create Regal Power by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement <note place="margin">The Law of God or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does not create Regal power by the ſubmiſſion, or any act of the Subject.</note> or ſubmiſſion of Men thereunto, or that Subjects were the eſſential inſtruments by which Regal Power was originally created, and yet is continued in the world; then were not Men only free from Regal or Higher Powers before they did ſubmit thereunto, but alſo free to make whom they would their Prince; and ſo by conſequence there can be no ſuch thing as Hereditary Monarchy in the world, which for many Hundred, nay Thouſand years (where God was not pleaſed to reign himſelf immediately over his peculiar people) was in the old time the only Government in the world. For above 3000 years after the Creation, was neither Ariſtocracy,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:200520:81"/> Democracy, or Elective Monarchy ever heard of in the world; and yet Hereditary Monarchy is in above 19 of 20 parts in the world the only Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Nor would any Government that ever was, or is in the world, grant this liberty to any one born in their dominion; but upon reſiſting it, or renouncing it, whether he ever ſubmitted to it or not, proceed againſt him not as an Enemy, but as a Rebel and Traitor.

                        <p n="15">15. Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> in his life of <hi>Henry</hi> 7. relates that <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi>

                        <p>Firſt, When it is immediately and expreſly given by God, as it was to <hi>Saul, David, Solomon, Hazael, Cyrus, &amp;c.</hi>

I do exclude Conqueſt to be any cauſe of Regal power, where God does not give it: For either this Conqueſt muſt be made by power, or force: If it be made by power, or one who is Gods Sword-bearer, no new power ariſeth from thence, but only a dilatation of the exerciſe of the old, which was formerly in him: But if it be done by Sword-takers, then is it no other then unjuſt uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and robbery.

It is true, and I grant that God does oftentimes for the puniſhment of a Nation, convert the ſucceſſion of their Kings into another line, (yet did he never ſo far chaſtiſe any Nation, as to ſubject it to an Ariſtocracy or Democracy.) So it is neceſſary, offences come; yet ſhall that never excuſe them by whom they come. And ſo it many times happens, that men cannot avoid Gods judgments, and die; it is no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence therefore, that men ſhould run themſelves into them, or kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It may be it is Gods will that my Father ſhould die, or that he will deſtroy my Country and Laws, &amp;c. It does not therefore follow, that a man may kill his Father, deſtroy his Country, or endeavor to ſubvert the Laws thereof. Men are not alwaies obliged to conform their wills to Gods will, but to do what he wills and commands them. I am obliged to pray for my Parents and Country, when it is Gods will they ſhould be deſtroyed. It was Gods will, that <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> for <hi>Solomons</hi> ſin, ſhould be King of ten <note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 13.</note> Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet becauſe the Tribes did will it, and not upon Gods command, he pronounced them eternal Rebels, and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> a Rebel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 19.</note> he took it upon thoſe terms, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 6.

By this which hath been ſaid, it is evident that the power of all <note place="margin">No power ariſes from Conqueſt.</note> Kings is alike and equal, <hi>viz.</hi> Supreme, and Gods Ordinance, and from the Law of Nature. The difference between Kings is only in the exerciſe of their power, ſome being contracted into narrower terms, and others of a more vaſt extent and dilatation. Where therefore one King extends the exerciſe of his power into the dominion of another, by conqueſt or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, no new power ariſeth from hence, but only an extenſion of the exerciſe of the old: And ſo by conſequence, the invaſion, uſurpation, or conqueſt of Subjects or others, who before had no Regal power, cannot create any after.</p>

And ſince it is impoſſible that two Supreme powers can be in one place; where any one King comes to be in the exerciſe of another Kings power, he is ſubject to that King ſo long as he continues in the exerciſe or dominion of that King. By more reaſon therefore ought the Subjects of any Prince to be in ſubjection to Supreme powers, ſo long as they continue in the exerciſe of their power, whether it were by Conqueſt, or not. Beſides, God hath ordained Supreme powers for mens preſervation, not their deſtruction. And there muſt be ſome viſible power upon earth, which may put a period to and decide differences, or they will be endleſs: But there is no power under heaven, but their ſword, that can put a period to the differences of Princes; what therfore in ſuch caſe the ſword decides, ought to be obeyed; and the conquered Subjects, nay Princes who come into the dominion or exerciſe of anothers power, ought to be ſubject to it, ſo long as they continue therein: God therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth <hi>Zedekiah</hi> a Rebel againſt <hi>Nebuchadnezzer.</hi> But this reaſon cannot <note place="margin">1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 36. 13.</note> hold for Subjects againſt their Soveraign, where the Law may decide their <note place="margin">Regal power cannot be transferred nor commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by any humane or voluntary act.</note> differences, and where by no Law of God or Man they are permitted to take the ſword.</p>

When therefore Subjects or Enemies do unjuſtly invade and poſſeſs the Dominion of another, this poſſeſſion does not diveſt the right or <hi>jus ad rem</hi> of that other, but only ſuſpend the exerciſe of the others power or right during ſuch uſurpation.

WHo hath the Supreme power, hath the ſword of Juſtice to puniſh <note place="margin">The ſword of Juſtice is his, who hath the Supreme power.</note> them who tranſgreſs Laws, and endeavour to cauſe ſedition: <hi>He is the Miniſter of God to thee for good; but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the ſword in vain; for he is the Miniſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. <hi>And Gods rod in his hand,</hi> Exod. 17. 9.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The end of all Government is, either to preſerve the governed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly <note place="margin">The power of making War and Peace, belongs to the Supreme power.</note> in peace, or to defend them from the outward violence and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of others. In vain therefore ſhould Government be, if he who hath the Supreme power, may not as well defend Subjects from the violence of others outwardly, as to preſerve them from factions and feditions within. And this power God gave to <hi>Moſes, Joſhuah, David,</hi> and all the Kings of <hi>Judah;</hi> nor can any King be a Supreme Prince without it, nor the governed in a probable condition of hoping for preſervation from it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Judgment is the determining of a good or bad action, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">All Judgment is with him.</note> be in any who is ſubject to another. What therefore could be a more ſubtile temptation of the Devil to our firſt Parents, then to tell them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. that by eating the forbidden fruit, they ſhould be like to God, knowing good and evil. <hi>Solomon,</hi> as the moſt requiſite thing, prays to God, that he would give him an underſtanding heart, that he might be able to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and bad, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 9. And, <hi>The King by judgment eſtabliſheth the land,</hi> Pro. 29. 4. And, <hi>Give the King thy judgments, O God, and thy righteouſneſs to the Kings Son, that he may judge the people according to right, and defend the poor,</hi> Pſal. 72. 1, 2.</p>

                           <hi>from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until Shilo come,</hi> Gen. 49. 10. <hi>Submit your ſelves therefore to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as Supreme,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 12. And this is the onely viſible means by which Subjects may become ſafe, rich and happy.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In puniſhment, Equals cannot judge Equals, much leſs can Inferiors <note place="margin">That he does all things without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> judge Superiors: But a Supreme Prince cannot have an Equal, much leſs a Superior; therefore a Supreme Prince cannot be puniſhed. If a Supreme Prince might be puniſhed for any thing he doth, then cannot he do any thing but he will be liable to puniſhment for ſo doing: For, what property can he give to one, which will not offend ſome other? Nor did the verieſt Thief or Murderer ever ſuffer puniſhment, but ſome of his Comrades would ſeek revenge, and if they might, would puniſh the Lawgiver. Beſides, who ſhall judge his Prince? If any one, then every one may. <hi>Let no man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be haſty to go out of his ſight, nor ſtand in an evil thing, for he doth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pleaſeth him. Where the word of a King is, there is power, and who ſhall ſay unto him, what doeſt thou?</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 3, 4. <hi>The Lord forbid that I ſhould do this thing unto my Maſter the Lords Anointed, to ſtretch forth my hand againſt him, ſeeing he is the Lords Anointed,</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 6.</p>
                        <p>It may ſeem to ſome, that this unlimited power of doing any thing <note place="margin">Annot.</note> with impunity, will only beget a confidence in Kings of doing what they liſt, without ever taking care of their duty in preſerving their Subjects from inteſtine broils and factions, and from the outward force and violence of their Enemies; whereas (more narrowly looked into) no men are ſo ſubject to care, and have their wills leſs then they: For, private men, if they do any thing in their paſſion, their fame and fortunes are alike, neither much removed from their perſons, few take notice of it: But they who are ſet in high place, all men take notice of their actions. In the greateſt Fortune therefore, is the leaſt Liberty; and that which in other men is termed Anger, in them is called Pride and Tyranny. Beſides, in private men it is enough that they themſelves do well; but Princes muſt have a care, that neither they, nor their Miniſters do ill.</p>

Humane Laws are the <note place="margin">The Supreme power is not obliged by his own Laws.</note> organs or inſtruments of the Power that governeth; they cannot therefore extend themſelves to bind him from whom they are derived; for, <hi>Omnis potentia activa, eſt principium tranſmutandi aliud.</hi> Beſides, the Prince may free other men from the obligation of the Laws, and therefore much more himſelf: And if Supreme Princes were obliged by their own Laws, then were Humane Laws, as well as the Laws of Nature, eternal and immutable, which is abſurd; nor could Humane Laws protect Subjects, when any thing happens (which comes to paſs every day) that was not foreſeen at the making of the Laws. Humane Laws are made to oblige and preſerve the governed, <hi>neceſsitate coactionis;</hi> but they cannot have any obligation upon Lawgiver who is the Supreme power, unleſs a man will grant that an Effect may be prime and ſuperior to the Cauſe. Nor were ever other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſubject to their own Laws. <note place="margin">No man hath any thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per againſt the Supreme power.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. No Subject hath any Property (except Eccleſiaſticks) but by the Laws of his Country: But by the precedent Propoſition, no Supreme Prince can be obliged by his own Laws, and therefore no Subject can have property againſt him. If any Subject had property againſt the Supreme
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:200520:87"/> power, then could not the Supreme power impoſe a Forfeiture of Goods in caſe of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> Attaint, Conviction of Treaſon or Felony: But the Conſequence is falſe, and therefore the Antecedent is falſe, That any man hath any property againſt the Supreme power. Beſides, there could no Fine, nor Fine and Recovery be levied or ſuffered, if he in Reverſion or Remainder had property againſt the Supreme power: Nor could an Act of Parliament enable Tenant for life to make ſale of his Eſtate.</p>
                        <p>It is remarkable, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould not be content to <note place="margin">Annot.</note> have God to reign over them immediately, who did himſelf give them Laws, being enquired of by the High-Prieſt. <hi>Samuel</hi> might well ſay therefore unto them, <hi>Ye ſhall cry in that day becauſe of your King, which</hi> (not ye ſhall chooſe, but which) <hi>ye ſhall have choſen you, and the Lord ſhall not hear you in that day,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 18. For Gods ways and actions are always perfect, whereas by the reaſon of humane frailty, the beſt mans actions are ſubject to imperfections. But if it ſeems grievous to any man, that he holds his goods at the will of another; let him conſider, that God, ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> did never give any Nation (but only the Children of Iſrael) Property, but always uſed the mediation of his Vicegerents: And ſince Property muſt be derived from ſome Humane act, (for the Law of Nature gives none but to Supreme Princes; and therefore the poſſeſſions of Kings are called <hi>Sacra patrimonia,</hi> becauſe Kings have no Superior but God Almighty: <hi>Proedium Domini Regis eſt directum dominium, cujus nullus Author eſt niſi Deus.)</hi> How <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Ed. Co. Com.</hi> on <hi>Lit. p.</hi> 1. 6.</note> much better is it for Subjects to hold of one Man, then of many? For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be objected againſt one, but will have more force againſt many: And let any man ſhew me in theſe laſt five hundred years, any Subjects eſtate taken from him without due and legal proceeding, by the act of any of the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> and I will ſhew him five hundred, who not being liable to any puniſhment by Law, have been ruined themſelves and their families in ſeven years, and that for obſerving the Laws, and againſt the will of the King.</p>
                        <p>
                           <label>Obj.</label> But many Actions have been brought againſt the King; which, if no <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Annot.</hi> 2.</note> man hath Property againſt him, may ſeem inconſiſtent. </p>
                        <p>
                           <label>Anſw.</label> But the queſtion here is not, what the King may do, but what he hath done; Not what the King may declare Law, but what he hath already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Law.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Majeſty is from the Law of Nature immediately; but the power <note place="margin">Power of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates from him.</note> of Magiſtrates is not ſo, but mediately, that is, from him who hath the Supreme power. Magiſtracie is the inſtrument or organ by which Majeſty is conveyed to every place, whither its own power is extended: And as Majeſty is reſtrained to the Laws of Nature, and is accountable to God for all the omiſſions and tranſgreſſions of them; ſo Magiſtrates are reſtrained to Humane Laws, and ought to give an account of their actions to him that hath the Supreme power. And as no man can offer violence or contempt to Humane Majeſty, but it is a contempt and violence to the Majeſty of Heaven; ſo no man can offer violence to, or contemn Magiſtrates, but it is done to Humane Majeſty, from whence their authority is derived. Wherefore Subjects muſt ſubmit to Governors who are ſent by Kings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                        <p>By this Propoſition it is evident, that although Supreme power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">Annot.</note> be divided, yet the exerciſe of it may: For where a King is an Enfant,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:200520:87"/> he cannot exerciſe his power, who can neither act any thing, nor expres what he would have done; nay it is impoſſible for the beſt and wiſeſt King that ever was, to exerciſe his power every where; for one body can be but in one place at once, though the power thereof may be diffuſed every where, as the light and influence of the Sun is diffuſed every where, although the body of it can be but in one place: And the exerciſe of power by Magiſtrates, is like Gods governing the world by natural cauſes, who being the firſt Mover of all things, produceth natural effects by the order of ſecond cauſes. <hi>Jethro</hi> his counſel to <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore is to be taken; <hi>Thou wilt ſurely weare away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thy ſelf alone. Exod.</hi> 18. 18.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Right of calling Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies belongs to Chriſtian Kings.</note> 
                           <hi>ipſa eſſe non poteſt;</hi> where any Law Divine or Humane, does give any thing, it gives all the means, by which this otherwiſe could not be had. And that God by the Law of Nature has given Kings a power to protect their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, we have ſufficiently demonſtrated; but it is impoſſible Princes ſhould protect and govern their Subjects, if they might not rule their actions. Now all actions and motions are either regular or irregular: All regular motions and actions may be reduced to one certain beginning; where the beginning is not one, and certain, there they may be called commotions or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, rather then motions or regular actions. But all Aſſemblies are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore they muſt be reduceable to ſome one certain principle, or they are irregular or commotions: If then Chriſtian Princes have not a right of calling Aſſemblies, but others as well as they; then muſt it either neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow that Chriſtian Princes have not power ſufficient to govern and protect their Subjects, and that their Subjects motions cannot be regular and orderly, but confounded and irregular, and ſo the law of nature, and the end for which God ordained Princes, inverted. For my part, I will not diſpute the Power of God in the planting of the Church, either under the old or new Law, how that he did diſpence with the actions and motions of his People and Miniſters, and ſet Father againſt Son, &amp;c. and that to make his Power known, he would plant his Church, notwithſtanding all Temporal Powers whatſoever: but this I do affirm, that God after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> did give to <hi>Moſes</hi> only this right of calling Aſſemblies, as appears clearly by <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 2. for only to him is the charge of making the Trumpets to call the congregation together; It is true, that <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>the ſons of</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall blow with their Trumpets.</hi> but neither <hi>Aaron</hi> nor the Prieſts had any Power to make them, but only <hi>Moſes;</hi> they muſt therefore have them from him, and be his Inſtruments; and this Power was given to <hi>Moſes</hi> as the ſupreme Magiſtrate, and not as High Prieſt, for <hi>Aaron</hi> was then High Prieſt, being before conſecrated, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. Nor was this Right given perſonally to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but as <hi>a Law to laſt for ever.</hi> If any allegation be made againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> becauſe he was a Prieſt, it muſt ceaſe with <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and the Kings after him, who were none; for <hi>Ioſhua</hi> by virtue of this ever laſting Law did call an Aſſembly of all the Tribes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Levi,</hi> to <hi>Sichem,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. diſſolved it.

The like did <hi>Aſa,</hi> when Religion was reſtored, and a ſolemn Oath of aſſociation for the reſtoring of it. <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> did it when <note place="margin">1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 20. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 34. 29, 30. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.</note> he proclaimed a publick Faſt, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 3. <hi>Jehu</hi> aſſembled them, when a ſolemn Sacrifice was to be performed. <hi>Joaſh,</hi> in a caſe of Dilapidations. <hi>Joſias,</hi> when the Temple was to be purified, and a maſs of ſuperſtition to be removed. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> made a law for the Prieſts and all their brethren to aſſemble, and in conformity to that law they did aſſemble; nor was this <note place="margin">

And ſince that God hath promiſed, that Kings ſhall be nurſing fathers, and Queens nurſing mothers to his Church, it muſt be meant of Chriſtian Kings; for this could not be of <hi>Joſias,</hi> becauſe he was a King at the time of this prophecy, or before; it could not therefore be meant of him, for the prophecy is <hi>de fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo, Kings ſhall be, &amp;c.</hi> Nor could it be meant of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> after him, for they were all Idolaters, and perſecutors of Gods Church. It was therefore meant of Chriſtian Kings: And how Kings can be Kings or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme powers, without this right, I do not underſtand: Nor can that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour's cauſing of wars and diſtraction, be otherwiſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably underſtood, but only where Kings and Supreme powers have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Faith. And that Chriſtian Kings did generally exerciſe this power after they became Chriſtians, we ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>

Nor did God give Kings to them only over whom he did reign by Covenant, but alſo to Heathens who had not known him; as to the <hi>Perſians, Syrians, Aſſyrians, &amp;c.</hi> he gave <hi>Cyrus, Hazael, Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, &amp;c.</hi> And all antique Hiſtory ſpeaks only of the Government by Kings; as <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſays, <hi>Principio rerum, gentium, nationumque imperium penes Reges erat;</hi> before any other Government was uſurped and made by Men.</p>

It were a fine may-game to be a King, if Kings might make their <note place="margin">How careful Princes ought to be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, or making Laws.</note> Will the rule of their actions. It is true indeed, God hath not in all things commanded Kings what Laws they ſhall govern their Subjects by: yet this natural law are all Princes obliged to, that their Laws by which they govern do more relate to the good of their Subjects in general, then their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſt: And no queſtion but a King commits a more grievous ſin doing any unjuſt thing to any of his Subjects, then if another had done it, in regard of the relations which are between them; as a Fathers doing an unjuſt thing to his Child, is a greater ſin then if another had done it, by how much by the Law of Nature he ought to have done well to his Child, rather then another. Princes therefore by the Law of Nature, in governing, ought to have more reſpect to the general good of their Subjects, then their own particular intereſt. Yet is Magnificence a Royal virtue; and therefore ought not the Revenues of the Crown to be parted with, by which it ſhould be maintained: Nor would it conduce to the benefit of the Subjects in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to make the Revenues of the Crown poor: Where Majeſty grows contemptible, the exerciſe of Regal power is never permanent. Princes therefore ought to have a great care, that by their vices, prodigality of the Revenues of the Crown, remiſs governing, or by ſo giving it over to others that they ſo much neglect it in themſelves, as to make themſelves vile and contemptible.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Though God hath not commanded Kings in all things, what are <note place="margin">Princes ought not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Gods Majeſty. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.</note> the Laws by which they ſhall govern; and therefore divers Kings govern their Subjects by ſeveral Laws, as their Subjects differ in nature and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Yet hath he forbidden all Kings to make Laws derogatory to his Divine Majeſty. <hi>Samuel</hi> therefore threatens <hi>Saul,</hi> as well as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that if he or they diſobey God, and do wickedly, they ſhall periſh both they and their King. And it was to <hi>Saul</hi> that God ſaid, that <hi>Rebellion was as the ſin of witchcraft, and ſtubborneſs as the wickedneſs of idolatry.</hi> Nor was the ſin of the Iſraelites in committing idolatry, under the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the leſs, though the King commanded it: Nor did God ſcarce <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 23.</note> ever ſhew a greater miracle, then in delivering the <hi>Three Children,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> diſobeying the Kings wicked commandment. Princes therefore ought not to be obeyed in commanding things derogatory to the Majeſty of God.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Nor ought Princes to be obeyed, when they command any thing <note place="margin">Or contrary to Religion.</note> contrary to Religion; for, <hi>The kingdom of Heaven and the righteouſneſs thereof is first to be ſought:</hi> But the kingdom of Heaven is only to be ſought by Faith and Religion. <hi>Daniel</hi> therefore ſinned not, when he obeyed not <hi>Darius</hi> in praying to God. Nor do all our Parliamentary Laws add any thing to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:200520:89"/> the obligation of mens worſhip and ſervice of God, in the Unity and Form of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for men were as much obliged in Conſcience before ſuch Laws, as after. Not but that Kings ought to have as great, or greater care of preſerving unity and peace in Gods Church, as in their Temporal Dominions; and therefore may puniſh diſturbers of the peace of the Church, as well as the State: Yet when the Temporal Magiſtrate ſhall arrogate to himſelf a power which our Saviour only left to his Church, and make all Eccleſiaſtical rights and conſtitutions depending and ſubordinate to the Civil, whereby the Enemies of our Church have taxed our Religion not for Chriſtian, but Parliamentary; no doubt but it is a crying ſin, and I wiſh there had never been any ſuch thing among us.</p>

And as God is to be obeyed before men, in all things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <note place="margin">Or the Laws of Nature.</note> Faith and Religion; ſo in the obſervance of the Laws of Nature, is God to be obeyed before men. As if a King commands me to diſhonor my parents, this can be but a Humane law; but to honor my parents, is a law which God hath written in my heart, and therefore ought to be preferred. If a King commands his Subjects to diſhonor him, or to deny obedience to him, this is but a Humane law; whereas by the law of Nature I ought to honor and obey my King: I therefore ought not to obey ſuch a law. <hi>Amurath</hi> the Second of that name, King of the <hi>Turks,</hi> upon a Vow reſigned his Kingdom to his ſon <hi>Mahomet;</hi> yet upon the League made by <hi>Uladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> with other Chriſtian Princes againſt him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his Regal authority, and ſo kept it until his death: And ſo might <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, if he had pleaſed; nor was <hi>Philip</hi> any other then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his Fathers, during his Fathers life.</p>
                        <p>The King makes a Law, giving the ſucceſſion of the Crown from the right Heir: This ought not to be received; for Princes inherit by a higher Law then Humane.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. The King commands a Judge to pervert Judgment; the Judge <note place="margin">Or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ought to give true Judgment; for all Humane Laws (in peaceable times) ought to be <hi>â priori,</hi> and proclaimed that all men after ſuch a time ſhould obſerve them. This verbal command of the King wanting this formality, and it being impoſſible for the Judge to obſerve both theſe commands; he ought, notwithſtanding this verbal command, to give Judgment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law.</p>
                        <p>The King, when there is no neceſſity or publick danger, commands me <note place="margin">Quaere.</note> who am no publick Executioner, without any Judicial ſentence to put a man to death, for which he can make no compenſation: As <hi>Davids</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Joab</hi> to murder <hi>Uriah;</hi> although we find <hi>David</hi> only reprehended and puniſhed therefore, yet ſure if <hi>Joab</hi> had not fulfilled <hi>Davids</hi> wicked command, he had not ſinned.</p>
                        <p>But you may object, Who ſhall judge whether this thing commanded be repugnant to Gods Majeſty, Mans faith, Religion, or the Law of Nature; the King, or the Subject? I ſay, though the Subject hath not an equal right of judging with the King, whether this thing ſhould be a Law, or not; yet every Subject hath a Conſcience, as well as the King, which muſt dictate <note place="margin">Whether Kings diveſt themſelves of Regality, by commanding what they ought not.</note> to him whether he ought to do, or not to do ſuch a thing.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. But if the King commands things contrary to Gods Majeſty, and Divine Laws, ought he not to be obeyed in thoſe things which do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them? It is ſo mad and wild an objection, as it is ſcarce worth an

                        <p>It is worth the while, if a mans patience will give him leave, to look back upon the thing calling it ſelf <hi>Parliament:</hi> how after they had made the King grant whatſoever they could think might be beneficial to the Subjects, (though I might be ſworne they never intended (as plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared afterward) the good, benefit, or liberty of the Subject;) what pious ways they invented to make themſelves great, and ſo good a Prince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and odious to his Subjects: As the demanding of ſix men, holding intelligence with his Subjects who had been in open hoſtility and rebellion againſt him, (an affront not to be endured by any King) to an ordinary and Legal Trial; this was not only denied, but Voted a Breach of the Priviledge of Parliament; whenas the Priviledge of Parliament extends not to ſo much as breach of the Peace, much leſs to Treaſon.

But if I may aſcribe to my ſelf a power of judging when I may reſiſt my Prince, then ought I to allow it in another; and ſo by conſequence, every man ſhould have a power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how long he ſhall continue in obedience, and not reſiſt his Soveraign.

Nay, where men did ever aſcribe to themſelves a right or power of reſiſting their Soveraigns, they did never ſtay there, but made all the unjuſt uſurpation and hoſtile invaſion they could upon them who continued in obedience to their Prince: And what Law of God,

By our Country-Laws, if a man aſſaulted another, who goeth back to ſome hedge, ditch, or wall, &amp;c. beyond which he cannot paſs, and then in his own defence kills the aſſaulter; yet ſuch a tender care had the Common-Law of a mans life, that though this were done by inevitable neceſſity in the preſervation of an innocent mans life, that he ſhould have ſuffered death therefore: And though by the Statute of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> he ſhall ſave his life, yet he ſhall forfeit his goods and chattels.

I ſay therefore, that there are many things ſo inherent in the Prince individually, that they are incommunicable to any other: And therefore the Prince offending herein either through humane frailty, or paſſion; yet if he command unjuſtly, the ſin is his in ſo commanding, and not the Subjects in obeying. As if a Prince makes unjuſt War, yet if the Subject obey him, it is not the Subjects ſin in obeying, but the Princes in making ſuch a War: For if Subjects might judge whether a War were juſtly undertaken, or not, and ſo be freed from his obedience, when he would judge it unlawful; then any, or all Subjects, either through fear or faction, might deſert their Prince in any War, and ſo the Prince left deſtitute of protecting himſelf or Subjects; whenas <hi>Salus populi est ſuprema lex;</hi> and of this is the Prince the ſole and individual Judge.

That is Majeſty, an Empire, which is the Arbitrator, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator, Controuler, and maker of all laws, and who juſtly has it, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable only to God: and this Empire is ſo eſſential to all Government that without it there can be no Kingdom or Commonwealth; there cannot be any property, any <hi>meum,</hi> or <hi>tuum,</hi> but what this Empire gives; no man has any ſecurity of his life or eſtate, but as he is preſerved and protected by this power or command: And though government do differ (as it hath been and yet is in many places of the world) <hi>in ſpecie, viz. Monarchy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> yet in all of them this power or command is the ſame and equal, <hi>viz. Supreme:</hi> And this power or command muſt be in one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> in one man, in one court, in one people; but if it be divided into two or more, it is either <hi>ſupervacaneous,</hi> or <hi>deſtructive;</hi> for thoſe two or more
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:200520:92"/> in whom this divided Empire does conſiſt, muſt either agree or diſagree in the ſame thing; if they agree to will or nill the ſame, then it is <hi>ſupervacaneous,</hi> for it had been all one if but one part had willed it; and <hi>fruſtra fit per plura, &amp;c.</hi> but if they diſagree in willing or nilling the ſame thing, it is deſtructive, for it is impoſſible for the Subject to obey, becauſe the Law it ſelf is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; and if the Subject obeys one, he diſobeys the other, and to obey neither brings <hi>Anarchy</hi> and confuſion upon all the governed: What is left then but the Subject to be divided, aſwell as the power? <hi>and a Kingdom divided in it ſelf cannot ſtand, St. Mar.</hi> 3. 24. Neither are the Governors, in whom this divided power or command does conſiſt, in any better caſe then the Subject; for,</p>

                        <p>It were infinite to enumerate the ſad conſequences which diviſion of Kingdoms have brought upon thoſe Kingdoms where they were made; Let any man look upon the Eſtate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, when it was divided by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great among his three ſons, <hi>Conſtantinus, Conſtantius, &amp; Conſtans.</hi> Nor did ever the Empire retain the name and dignity, after the diviſion made by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to his ſons <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius.</hi> Nor was the Weſtern Empire ever raiſed again to near the greatneſs it had in <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> time, after the diviſion made by <hi>Lotharius, Lewis,</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> ſons of <hi>Lodovicus Pius;</hi> and what horrible confuſions followed upon the diviſions, is eaſie to be imagined, whenas in the firſt Battel between the brethren, was ſlain the greateſt part of the Nobility of <hi>France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and more men died in it then in any other battle that hapned in <hi>France,</hi> ſince that fought between <hi>Ecius</hi> and <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> in the fields of <hi>Catalonia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But that we may not go ſo far, and yet find examples neerer home, <hi>Rodry Maure,</hi> or <hi>Rodry</hi> the great King of <hi>Wales,</hi> Son of <hi>Merſyn Frith,</hi> had iſſue three Sons, <hi>Mervin, Anarawd,</hi> and <hi>Cadelh.</hi> In the yeare when he dyed <hi>viz. anno. dom.</hi> 877. (King <hi>Alfred,</hi> alias <hi>Alured</hi> then reigning in <hi>England)</hi> this Great <hi>Rodry</hi> divided his Kingdome of <hi>Wales</hi> into three Principalities. The Firſt he called <hi>Guyneth,</hi> the Engliſh <hi>Northwales,</hi> the Latiniſt <hi>Venedotia.</hi> The Second Principality was called <hi>Powiſland,</hi> in Latine <hi>Powiſia,</hi> of ſome <hi>Weſtwales</hi> bordering upon <hi>England.</hi> The Third he called <hi>Deherborth,</hi> the Engliſh <hi>Southwales,</hi> in Latine <hi>Demetia.</hi> The Firſt Principality, ſome ſay he gave to <hi>Mervin,</hi> others to <hi>Anarawd.</hi> The Second to <hi>Anarawd,</hi> ſome ſay to <hi>Cadelh.</hi> The Third to <hi>Cadelh,</hi> ſome ſay to <hi>Mervin.</hi> The Firſt was the beſt becauſe it was quieteſt. The Second often invaded and troubled by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Into the Third often incurſions were made by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Norman,</hi> and <hi>Fleming.</hi> The diviſion of this Kingdom (however it was) wrought in proceſs of time, ſuch a diviſion between theſe Princes, as it was never quiet untill it came under one Monarch or King again: for the Royal dignity of a Monarch or King, from whence all ſubordinate dignities, <hi>tanquam lumen de lumine,</hi> are derived, without any diminution, will ſuffer no diviſion, <hi>Regia dignitas eſt indiviſibilis; &amp; quaelibet alia derivativa dignitas, eſt ſimiliter indiviſibilis.</hi>

                        <p>The moſt woful event that fell out in this Kingdome, when <hi>Gordobug</hi> divided this Kingdom between his two Suns, <hi>Ferrex</hi> and <hi>Porrex,</hi> and what
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:200520:92"/> heavy event came to paſs, untill it was reduced again under one Monarch, let our Hiſtories tell you; and letting paſs others, I cannot overpaſs the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate within this Kingdom under the Heptarchy; untill all was reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under one Soveraign; and this is the reaſon that in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Royal dignity is deſcendible to the eldeſt daughter or ſiſter, <note place="margin">Sir <hi>E.

Monarchy in reaſon is the beſt Government, for the dignity and <note place="margin">Monarchy is the beſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in reaſon.</note> majeſty of one man is more eaſie to be maintained then of many; The ills that follow from bad Monarchs, are no worſe than what do and alwaies did happen from the beſt of humane Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> miſchiefs to particular men; Nor can the miſchiefs which happened to <hi>Silus, Sabinus, Sillanus, &amp;c.</hi> (who not well brooking the powers of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Caligula,</hi> Emperors as bad as who were worſt) had been over laviſh of their tongues in vilifying the power of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and magnifying that of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and probably had they been able, would have advanced the power of the <hi>Senate,</hi> to the abdication of <hi>Caeſars)</hi> be compared with the inconveniences which came upon the <hi>Senate</hi> and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> in thoſe times of <hi>Silla,</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Pompey:</hi> Beſides, factious and diſcontented perſons cannot hope for that encouragement in their deſigns, where the ſupreme power is in one individual perſon, as where it is compounded of many. The freedome and liberty of the Subject is more under one, then more, for it is eaſier to obey one then many: The common people of <hi>Rome</hi> never enjoyed ſo much liberty as under the Emperors; and therefore when after the death of <hi>Caligula,</hi> the <hi>Senate</hi> endeavored to reſtore <hi>Rome</hi> to her antient liberty as they <note place="margin">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:200520:93"/> univerſe, framed and compounded in ſuch admirable order and harmony, to whoſe great example ought every good King (who is the Unite, the minde, and centre of his kingdome) that hopes to govern and preſerve his ſubjects not only ſafe, but honeſt and happy, wholly to betake himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. By woful experience: I do not find any mans life, (except the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and depoſed Princes, <hi>Arthur, Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. and his ſonne, <note place="margin">By wofull experience.</note>

(If the diſſolution of the Abbies by <hi>Hen,</hi> 8. be objected, I anſwer, it was uſual in Parliament, to alter many things in the Common law: as the ſtatute <hi>de donis conditionalibus,</hi> made a great alteration in the Common law; for before, all eſtates which were not for life and under, were either in fee abſolute or conditional; and ſo the Statutes which gave power of entry, where before no remedy was to be had by Common law, but by a <hi>Cui in vita:</hi> And to Jointenants to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell others to ſue a Writ of partition, &amp;c. In caſe of life, the ordinary way of trial was by Peers, the Nobility by the Nobility, and the Commons by the Commons: but a Parliament being a body compounded of heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and diſſimilary parts, <hi>viz.</hi> King, Lords, and Commons, could not be Peers to any man, which was the uſual way of Trial with us; neither were the Eſtates ſo taken from Abbots, &amp;c. but that they enjoyed them, or a full value in lieu of them, during their lives, ſo that by this act no wrong was done to any man living: Yet it is true which Sir <hi>Ed. Co.</hi> ſaies in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <hi>Magna charta, chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Quod datum eſt Eccleſiae, datum eſt Deo,</hi> what was given to the Church, was given to God; which by the Law of God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16, 37, 38. is unalterable, nor can be be employed to any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane or common uſe.) So that I am confident, I may ſafely affirm, that the Subject in ſeaven years under the Long Parliament ſuffered extraordinarily and extrajudicially, five hundred times more, then all their Anceſtors in 500 years before, did from their Kings: The Barons warrs and thoſe of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter, Wat Tyler, Jack Straw, &amp;c.</hi> were cauſed by the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtubborneſs of the Subject; nor is the ſacred patrimony of the Crown and Church more ſecure then that of private men, but invaded and made a prey to ſoldiers, Sequeſtrators and Exciſe-men.</p>

                           <note n="a" place="margin">Hereditary Monarchy is better than elective in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Subject.

Hereditary Monarchy is better then Elective, in relation to the Subject. If a man but conſiders the calamities brought upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, only by chooſing their Emperor, it were ſufficient to make any man feat and tremble (that hath ſo much compaſſion in him as to pity wretched States) for that Nation who chooſe their King. When <hi>Caeſars</hi> line was extinct in <hi>Nero, Galba<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> was ſcarce choſen and received Emperor, when <hi>Otho</hi> excites the Pretorian Cohorts to kill him and his adopted ſon <hi>Piſo,</hi> to make way for himſelf. <hi>Vitellius</hi> is choſen almoſt at the ſame inſtant by the German Legions, that <hi>Otho</hi> was choſen by the Pretorian Cohorts: By this diviſion the Empire is brought to ſo deſolate a condition, that <hi>Otho</hi> (a vitious man) did kill himſelf, to prevent its further deſtruction; yet
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:200520:93"/> could not <hi>Otho's</hi> death purchaſe his Countries quiet: For, the <hi>Moeſian, Pannonian,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatian</hi> Legions, aſcribe to themſelves as good right in chooſing an Emperor, as the <hi>German,</hi> and name <hi>Veſpaſian. Rome</hi> the Miſtreſs of the known World, never felt ſuch miſery, as thoſe Legions led by <hi>Antonius Primus</hi> brought upon her; which <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> in the latter end of the third book, and the beginning of the fourth book of his Hiſtory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. That Emperor the Soldiers choſe, ſcarce ever pleaſed the Senate; what Emperor the Senate choſe, never pleaſed the Soldier. From <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> to <hi>Diocleſian</hi> (who was the greateſt Perſecutor of the Chriſtians, and renounced the Empire to take upon him a private life) not one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of ten died a natural death. In <hi>Gallienus</hi> his time, Thirty at once; at no time leſs then three or four, but like <hi>Hydra's</hi> heads, when one was cut off, another ſprung up: Into ſuch a condition was the Empire brought by the Election of the Emperors. Nor was the ſtate of the Weſtern Empire much better, which he who reads the Hiſtory of thoſe times from <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, until the Conſtitution of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 5. <hi>Anno</hi> 1002. for chooſing <note place="margin">

                        <p n="7">7. The miſeries conſequent upon the election of either Native or <note place="margin">The miſeries conſequent upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a Subject.</note> Stranger, are many: For there is no Native, who is not in diſtaſte with ſome body; the chooſing of whom gives power to take revenge not only upon him, but thoſe that oppoſed him in his election; for it is hardly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, all ſhould agree in one. None of the rejected Competitors will be content to acknowledge the Elected; in ſtead thereof they will rather ſtudy ways to raiſe diſſention about the manner of the Election, that either undue means were uſed in it, or though they had the fewer Votes, yet they who voted for them, were greater, better, or more Saint-like, whoſe Votes ought rather to be weighed, then the others numbred. Theſe, it may be, and many other conſiderations have cauſed the <hi>Polonians,</hi> theſe many years, to look for him whom they chooſe their King, out of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. Let us ſee what the miſeries conſequent upon chooſing of a Stranger <note place="margin">The miſeries upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a Foreiner, be he King or Subject.</note> are. He who is choſen, is either a Subject, or a Soveraign, (for between theſe two is no mean:) If he be a Subject, who (eſpecially freeborn Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign people) will endure that another being a ſtranger, and a Subject too, ſhould command over them? And where power is deſpiſed, the exerciſe of it is never permanent. If he be a Soveraign, he having now two Kingdoms, can perſonally reſide but in one, which will diſguſt the other: It will be expected, that he obſerve the manners and diſpoſitions of this Kingdom more then his other, becauſe the people choſe him; It will be expected by that Kingdom, that he retain the obſervations of the diſpoſitions and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of it, becauſe he is their born King. <hi>Philip</hi> the Second did diſguſt the <hi>Flemings,</hi> becauſe he retained his Spaniſh habit. He cannot do any thing ſo much in order to the good of the one, but it will as much excite the other to hate him; in being a ſervant to both, he ſhall pleaſe neither. And what was it which cauſed all thoſe Wars raiſed in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but the Election of <hi>Frederick,</hi> 1619. from whence too ſprung all thoſe devaſtations, and almoſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:200520:94"/> deſtructions in <hi>Germany</hi> ſince, until the laſt Treaty at <hi>Munſter.</hi> From hence it was, that <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the ſon of <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> being choſen King of <hi>Poland,</hi> the Kingdoms differing both in Manners and Religion, (and it being impoſſible to pleaſe both) was not only himſelf, and all his poſterity for ever excluded from the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in a Conſpiracie at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copen,</hi> 1600. but hath been the cauſe of all that miſery and deſolation under which <hi>Poland</hi> lately lay: For, becauſe <hi>Caſimir</hi> the ſon of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> will not renounce the Right which God by Primogeniture has given him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this <hi>Barbarian</hi> and Uſurper; he joining with the <hi>Brandenburgher</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvanian,</hi> (and ſeeks aid of the <hi>Turk</hi> too, who being the beſt Chriſtian of theſe four, refuſeth to give him any) robs, ruines and ſpoils <hi>Poland.</hi> Add hereunto the calamities and confuſions which happen in the intervals of their Kings; which whoſo reads the Hiſtory of <hi>Pole,</hi> may ſee: Whereas in an Hereditary Kingdom, where the Heir is known and a Major, no confuſions probably follow: And no man ſure will deny, but that an Hereditary Monarchy is better for the peace and quiet of the people, then an Elective.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Hereditary Monarchy is better then Elective, in relation to the <note place="margin">Hereditary Monarchy is better then Elective, in reference to the Crown and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> Rights, Patrimony, and Dignity of the Crown: For where the Crown deſcends to the Heir, the King will uſe what means he can for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the honor and dignity thereof, that himſelf in his poſterity, as well as his perſon, may be great and renowned: whereas he who cannot hope that his Heir ſhall enjoy it, will uſe what means he can for proviſion and maintenance for his Children, although it be to the prejudice and diſhonor of it; for ſure no man can imagine, that becauſe a Man is a King, that therefore he ſhould diveſt himſelf of Nature, and neglect to uſe ſome means to get an Eſtate for his Poſterity, where there is none provided? If it be objected, that the Crown deſcends to the Heir, not to the poſterity, if more then one: I anſwer, That no Crown but hath many Offices and Dignities appertaining to it, which deſcend to the Heir, he probably will not reject his own fleſh and blood to advance ſtrangers; whereas in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Kingdom it cannot be hoped for.</p>

The ſame things therefore the Gods both love and hate; and thoſe things which are envied by ſome, are grateful to other of the Gods, and the ſame things ſacred, and prophane; which <hi>Euthy.</hi> could not deny. Such is the condition of men in Ariſtocracies and Democracies, that while they ſeek to pleaſe one part of their Governors, they diſpleaſe another. Nor can men in ſuch a condition be ſecure, that obeying one part, they ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe another part, and ſo excite them to endleſs debates and war. The ſad and woful truth of theſe things, this poor Nation hath of late made ſufficient trial of.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. There is nothing in this world, but is ſubject to humane frailty; <note place="margin">The incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of Monarchy.</note> no Roſes without prickles. And though Monarchy be the beſt of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet ſo long as it is exerciſed by Men, and ſince Kings are but Men, and therefore ſubject to humane frailty, it cannot be expected that all Kings ſhould ſo perfectly exerciſe their authority, but that ſome miſchiefs will
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:200520:96"/> happen from them: Nor indeed can it be imagined but ſome miſchiefs will happen to particular men, from the beſt of Humane Laws; yet without Humane Laws and Government, can never the inconvenience of Tumults and Confuſions be avoided.</p>
                        <p>The Objections againſt Monarchy, are uſually,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That in the infancie of a King, all things are ſubject to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and alteration. <hi>It is true; and therefore God pronounceth ſuch an eſtate</hi>

                           <hi>woful: Yet is ſuch an eſtate no worſe then Ariſtocracy, which is better then Democracy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, That ſubſequent Kings do not deſire to rule by the Laws made by their Anceſtors, but by Laws made by themſelves; and ſo their Subjects are always in an unſetled condition, and ſubject to alterations. <hi>The Laws of the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Perſians <hi>were unalterable, yet the Government was always Monarchy. And let a man look into all places of the known world, where the Government is Hereditary Monarchy, if the Government be not from long received and eſtabliſhed Laws, which is the Princes greateſt ſecurity; and therefore in reaſon ought rather to ſuffer ſome miſchief from them, then venture an inconvenience by altering them: Whereas in the other Governments, where Factions and mens Intereſts bear ſo great a ſway, they are daily ſubject to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and alteration. And let any man ſee how unlike all the Parliaments ſince</hi> 1640. <hi>have been in their Intereſts and Factions; and all of them would have innovated all the eſtabliſhed Laws of this Nation, if they could have agreed upon any thing in ſtead of them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, That it is an unreaſonable thing, Mens lives and eſtates ſhould terminate in the Will of one Man, and it may be this Man a wicked and tyrannous Man. <hi>But if it be neceſſary that theſe things muſt depend upon ſome Humane cauſe, how much better is it for Men to be ſubject to one Man then many?</hi> Nor can any thing be objected againſt Monarchy, but will be of more force againſt either of the other Governments.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. Thoſe Men who imagine to frame a Democracy or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth <note place="margin">It is abhorrent and impoſſible to frame a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in <hi>England</hi> from the example of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                           </note> here in <hi>England,</hi> from the example of the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Athenians, &amp;c.</hi> let them conſider two things. Firſt, That by a general abhorrence of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, Democracy hath been exploded upon the face of the Earth for above 1700 years, (if the Cantons of <hi>Switzerland</hi> be not Democratical, who have almoſt ever ſince their Rebellion againſt <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> about the year 1400. (when they firſt formed themſelves into a Democracy) continued merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mankillers to the Intereſts of the Pope, and the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.)</hi> Secondly, The ſtate of the Inhabitants of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> were the People, who were <hi>Civitate donati,</hi> Libertines, or abſolute Slaves; but with us the Caſe is quite another thing; for, every Man hath as much right to his Freedom as another, by birth. It is therefore meer folly, from Cauſes ſo unlike, to produce like things. Beſides, if a man conſiders the condition of this Nation ever ſince Monarchy was rejected, that in leſs then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of Twenty years, the Publique Charge hath been twenty times more then in Five hundred years before; Not only the Nobility and Gentry in general ſequeſtred and undone, but the Publique Revenues both of Church and Crown waſted and ſold, all Veneration of Divine and Humane Laws loſt and neglected, all Commerce with Foreign Nations interrupted, and the Nation hated and deſpiſed by Foreigners; the moſt Renowned places, which the Piety of our Anceſtors founded
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:200520:96"/> for the Worſhip and Service of God, prophaned and made Stables for Horſes; The Governors, in ſtead of minding the Publick good, intending only by all unjuſt means to prefer themſelves and creatures; And at this day a greater Debt upon the Nation, then our Parliaments for 400 years have given our Kings, (except the ſacrilegious gifts of Church-lands) and the Nation ſtill degenerating into worſe; ſure no ſober man would be in love with Commonwealths.</p>

Sedition properly ſignifies <note place="margin">Seditio, quid.</note> a going apart, or aſunder: As the ſubmitting and uniting of Subjects to their lawful head, cauſes peace and quiet, from whence follows eaſe and plenty; ſo ſedition cauſes diſcord and War, which unleſs timely ſuppreſſed, either ends in Tyranny, that is, by ſetting up one or more of the ſeditious, in place of him who by right ought to command, or opens a gap to be overwhelmed of forrain powers. See <hi>Hobbs de Cive, cap.</hi> 12.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This is the moſt antient ſin, the firſt of our firſt parents, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <note place="margin">The deſire of judgment diſpoſes men to ſedition.</note> of being like to God, judging good and evill: <hi>Therefore God ſent him out of the garden to till the ground, Gen.</hi> 3. 22, 23.

It is impoſſible that judgment removed from the head, ſhould abide any where: for the unreaſonable appetite of men doth deem things good or bad, not as they are in themſelves, but as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear profitable, or not, to them; from whence it comes to paſs, that the ſame action is praiſed by one man as virtuous, and by another is blamed as vitious; neither can there be any remedy for this thing, but the ſubmiſſion of every mans judgment, to the judgment of another. Beſides judgment of good and evil, is to put an end to all difference; and what end can there be of difference, when as either every man may judge alike, or no man can tell who ſhall be Judge?</p>

What follows? No private man but may aſſume to himſelf as much liberty as another, and every man will deſire to ſeem as tender-conſcienced as another; ſo that, <hi>In nomine Domini incipit omne malum:</hi> Men pretending conſcience, deſtroy all ſociety and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:200520:97"/> It is therefore a ſeditious opinion to affirm, that ſubjects ſin obeying their Soveraigns in all things not contradicting Faith, Religion, or the Law of Nature.</p>

And what private man can aſſume to himſelf the knowledge of good and evil, that is, aſcribe to himſelf a power over his Superior, by judging whether he hath tranſgreſſed the Law, or not? And let any man ſhew that ever our Parliaments, as they call themſelves, Councils of State or Safety, were ever obliged by their own Laws, and I will ſubmit that rightful Princes are obliged by their own Laws.</p>

                           <hi>viz.</hi> That a man hath power to protect, reward, and puniſh another. And prudent Princes ought ſo to maintain the reputation of this in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that it may be received and believed of all: For beſides that ill men will, where there is no fear of puniſhment, become more licentious; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all men ambitiouſly (where they are not reſtrained by fear) deſire to inſult over their Superiors. <hi>Aeſop</hi> gives an Item of this laſt, in the Fable of the Logg which <hi>Jupiter</hi> gave the Frogs for their King; when they became fearleſs of it, every one jumped inſultingly upon it: And examples of the former are clearly ſeen in men, who condemned for offences to death, they penitently acknowledge their faults, and deſire forgiveneſs of that Power that puts them to death; whereas ſcarce any offender fearleſs of puniſhment, did ever ſubmit and ask forgiveneſs for it. Princes therefore ought princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to take care, how either by their vices, remiſs Government, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they make their perſons or power contemptible; for when power is contemptible, the exerciſe of it is never permanent.</p>

If the Age tends to worſe, and men of this latter Age have been <note place="margin">Conceſſions of Princes to their Subjects, diſpoſes them to ſedition.</note> worſe then in the precedent, as men generally hold; and if Princes power, in Ages when Mankind did not ſo faſt degenerate into all forbidden wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, were not ſufficient at all times to reſtrain the ſeditions and diſorders
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:200520:98"/> of their Subjects; then is it a moſt unreaſonable thing in Princes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge this ambitious deſire of their Subjects, by granting them liberties and priviledges which they had not before. And if any man can ſhew that ever any where in the world, Princes did make their Subjects better by granting them a more then uſual liberty, but only made them more arrogant to demand more, until their Majeſties and Authorities became ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, that in ſtead of governing their Subjects, they muſt be content to have what terms their Subjects pleaſe to impoſe upon them, or to reject them, which in the end they will aſſuredly do; I will be content to believe Princes do prudently, by granting to their Subjects all their real Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, and retaining only, or ſome ſmall matter more, then the empty Title.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. It is not only the office of a Prince, that good Laws be made, but <note place="margin">If Laws be not carefully executed.</note> that they be carefully put in execution. There is no man who does not will and deſire to be happy; but few men who are daily ſollicitous and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to attain to happineſs. It is the part of fooliſh men, only to will and wiſh; but the part of prudent men, to do wiſely. A man ſhall ſee it in a family, where the Maſter only commands, and never looks to the doing, that in a ſhort time, though he commands much, he will have little performed: And where Subjects have gotten a licentious habit of neglecting or tranſgreſſing Laws, it will prove a hard thing to reclaim them, whereas they might have been eaſily preſerved in their obedience by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful execution of the Laws.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. There is nothing more dangerous in Church or State, then Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: <note place="margin">Alterations of Laws.</note> It is therefore the moſt ſecure way of governing (when mens manners and vices do not require new Laws) by the antient and received Laws of a Nation: This will ſecure the Prince from the imputation of Tyranny; he may better hope to preſerve a ſtrong houſe built upon a ſure foundation, then by deſtroying it, to undertake to build another, which he either knows not how to finiſh, or having built it, cannot hope it will be better then the other, or cannot tell whether it will be of any continuance, but falling will overwhelm him in the ruine of it. Beſides, the Subjects from the example of their Prince will become ſtudious of innovation, and cenſure whatſoever Laws he preſcribes in lieu of the old ones: Thoſe he gives, if they pleaſe one, will diſpleaſe another; it will be the only talk of the City, Country, and Market: If he puniſh any oppoſer, (for it is not poſſible but diſadvantage will be to many, and the loſer will ſpeak) he ſhall by all his faction be cried up for a Martyr and Patriot of his Country and Laws: It will make Subjects diffident of their condition, and fearful that having Property by the old Laws, they ſhall loſe all by new ones. Yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this world can ſecure men, and make their condition permanent: For, what is uſually objected by ſeditious men againſt their Prince, <hi>viz.</hi> the invading and not ſuffering freeborn Subjects to have the benefit of their antient Laws and Cuſtoms, was imputed a crime to our late King, who was perſecuted by his own Subjects, becauſe he adhered to the known and received Laws of the Land; for, after the year 1642. there was not any Petition preſented to the King by one or both Houſes of Parliament, but was againſt the eſtabliſhed Laws of this Nation. But no queſtion, it was not the Kings adherence to the Laws, but the iniquity of the Times, which brought ſo great a calamity upon himſelf, his Queen and Poſterity.</p>

If there be any happineſs in this world or the world to come, which <note place="margin">Reſuming any thing granted to Subjects.</note> may be hoped for by any man, no queſtion but it is to be attained by Juſtice and Obedience; and Juſtice and Obedience is, in receiving and doing the Commands of our Superiors; nor can any one be a juſt or obedient man in any thing, wherein he makes not his Superior (that is, God, Church, King, Father, Mother, or Maſter) the reaſon or rule of it. Yet there is nothing more deſired and pretended by ignorant and ſeditious men, then liberty: And wherein do they place this liberty, but in weakening the power of him to whom they owe their ſubjection? And the more any Prince grants to his Subjects, the more liberty the Subjects aſcribe to themſelves, and the leſs power to their Soveraign; and will rather be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by forein Enemies, then endure that their true Prince ſhall infringe their liberties by reſuming any thing granted them, although it be for their neceſſary defence and preſervation.</p>

Government is endangered either by inteſtine broils which are <note place="margin">Granting pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges to particular places, cauſes ſedition.</note> raiſed by factious and ſeditious men, or forein war; and Princes ought to be more careful to preſerve their Subjects in general from inteſtine then forein war: For beſides that civil wars are more dangerous to the Crown then forein, ſo inteſtine wars always end in loſs of ſubjects in general, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by forein wars much benefit may ariſe to King and ſubjects. And there is nothing ſo much deſired, and that can ſo much conduce to the ſuppreſſion of factions and ſeditions, as the equal and due adminiſtration of the ſame Laws to Subjects in general. But in vain ſhall Princes endeavor to ſuppreſs factions and ſeditions, when they make them, by making ſo many Factions, as they make Corporations: For who does not ſee what an antipathy there is between the Country-Juſtices, and the Magiſtrates (as they call them) of Corporations, where they agree not <hi>in aliquo tertio,</hi> that is, in ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, plainly in advantage of the Corporation?

Well therefore might <hi>Cato Major</hi> in his great wiſdom cry out in open Senate, That ſoldiers and men of war were to be ſtill buſied in arms far from home; for that in ſo doing all ſhould go well with the State, and the glory thereof increaſe. And the <hi>Romans</hi> always judged an external war the moſt requiſite
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:200520:99"/> and neceſſary remedy to prevent an inteſtine.

It is therefore a miſerable condition in which Princes are (without Gods great and ſpecial favor to them) that either they muſt maintain a forein war, and ſo become accountable to God for all the blood which ſhall be ſpilt, if unjuſtly undertaken; or elſe by long peace and eaſe diſpoſe their own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the ruining and deſtroying of one another.

Beſides the excellencies of Military diſcipline, (not but that any thing may be abuſed) by which Nations are protected from Foreign enemies; not only Religion, Juſtice, Peace, Learning, &amp;c. are internally preſerved; it alſo makes men induſtrious and active in buſines, valiant in dangers, temperate in their deſires, and to be wary and prudent in their actions. It is indeed an admirable thing to conſider, how the moſt wiſe, greateſt, and beſt God hath attempered all things: Not only that all things are differing, if not contrary to one another, but alſo hath made and placed all Nations ſo enemies one to one another, that he may by the help of one, revenge the injury and injuſtice which is done by another; that ſo from fear of danger, all might be kept within the bounds of their duty.

It were the moſt eaſie and natural thing in the world to govern well, if the violent and rigid execution of Laws againſt all offenders, would cure the maladies of State; nay, Subjects ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (though peccant) where the pardoning may appear an act of grace, not remiſneſs, and the example not encourage others to the like offence. Puniſhment ought always to look forward, never backward; that is, Princes in puniſhing ought by the example to deter others from the like offence; not to take pleaſure in puniſhing any who hath offended him. <hi>I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the houſe of Jehu, and will cauſe to ceaſe the houſe of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 1. 4. How ſhould God avenge the blood of <hi>Jezreel</hi> upon the houſe of <hi>Jehu,</hi> whenas <hi>Jehu</hi> did nothing but what the Lord commanded him? The reaſon is given, that <hi>Jehu</hi> took pleaſure in executing ſo dreadful a judgment upon his Maſters houſe. Weak and indiſpoſed bodies are killed, never cured by violent phyſick; nor will Patients ever ſeek to Phyſitians, who they fear will rather kill than cure them. Princes who by violent and cruel ways do govern, ſuppreſs, yet nouriſh a fire, which breaking out will hardly be quenched: Yet it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the fate (I dare not think through the fault) of moſt ſerene and clement Princes, to ſuffer death and martyrdom from the ſenſleſs rage and fury of their ſeditious Subjects. If then the inſite piety of the moſt devout, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and beſt of Princes, adorned with all the excelling virtues of Patience, Temperance, Chaſtity, Juſtice, Mercy, love and tender care of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Magnanimity in Adverſity, Moderation in Proſperity, could not ſecure Innocent Majeſty from the violence of unnatural Subjects; ſure, Peace and happineſs may by other men be endeavored and prayed for in the next World, but it can ſcarcely be hoped for in this.</p>
                        <p>If there were neither Heaven nor Hell, no hope of bliſs, or fear of <note place="margin">Annot.</note> puniſhment hereafter; yet ſure, ſo much Morality ſhould be harbored in humane breaſts, as not cauſeleſly to offer violence or injury to them of their own kind: How much more unnatural, ingrateful, and inhumane then is it for Subjects, againſt all Oaths of faith and allegiance, not only not to make any reſtitution of thoſe things which they hold of their Prince, before they attempt any thing againſt him, but alſo to imploy them all to the deſtruction of that Perſon and Power, by whoſe grace and favor they enjoyed them. And if that Monarchy be Tyranny, as Libertines affirm, and that all power is from the People; then ought they not in reaſon to condemn it in the cauſe, and allow it in the effect, and rob the People of ſo great a part of their original right, by retaining their Eſtates which were all mediately or immediately holden of the Crown. If Regal power be unjuſt and uſurped in the cauſe, then cannot any act of it be juſt or legal; and ſo by conſequence
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:200520:100"/> all theſe famous Aſſertors of Liberty do unjuſtly and illegally hold their Eſtates, which are nothing but Conceſſions originally from the Crown, and do unjuſtly uſurp them from the People, from whom originally all power is derived. And where theſe men complain ſo much of unjuſt, illegal, and arbitrary power of a Prince; let any man ſhew where ever, after they had uſurped Regal power, they made Juſtice, Law, Equity or Reaſon, but only their Rage and Will, the rule of their Actions and Laws.</p>

Where men therefore will not indifferently ſubmit themſelves to the juſt and legal eſtabliſhed Government in Church and State, there neceſſarily muſt men (whatever they pretend or hope for) be forcibly governed by Arms, or they will infinitely deſtroy one another. It is true indeed, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, (who being of all mortal men the moſt unfit for a Churchman, aſcribed to himſelf the Headſhip of the Church, and) having converted to his own uſe ſo great a part of the Church-lands, the veneration which men retained of the Church, became vile and contemptible, and the Crown loſt the chief ſupport thereby. The Crown thus left almoſt without ſupport, it deſcended to a Child; in whoſe Ariſtocratical reign, not only the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and divers other Religious Houſes were given by the Parliament and Biſhops to the King, but almoſt all things Sacred became a prey to the ravenous Courtiers. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> endeavored to have had reſtored all to the Church again; but the lands being incorporated into particular mens eſtates, it was not in her power. After her, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by Act of Parliament ſo ſtopt the precipice of things, that what was left in the Church, might not be aliened or made worſe by the Poſſeſſor; yet ſo, that ſhe left a gap open for herſelf and her Favorites to prey upon it: which was after ſhut by King <hi>James,</hi> and with great care ſecured by King <hi>Charls.</hi> All this while grew up a Faction in Church and State, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ruine of both: For not only in the Church, the Publique Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, Communion, or Religion, was vilified and defamed; but the Governors reviled with all opprobrious names of <hi>Tyrannical, Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, &amp;c.</hi> It is true, the Majeſty of the King was not ſo openly reviled, yet was it inſenſibly daily undermined by them; in which they were much aſſiſted by a company of half-headed Lawyers, who in all Aſſemblies diſtilled this doctrine into ignorant men, <hi>That the Law was above the King; and that they had Property againſt him in their eſtates and goods.</hi> Whereby not only Citizens and Great places became generally inclined to this new doctrine of the Teachers and Lawyers; but the Country-Gentleman thought himſelf independent from the King both in his life and eſtate; the Yeoman cared not for the Gentleman, and as little regarded the King; ſo that the veneration of the Royal Name became every day more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:200520:101"/> and deſpiſed; all honor and reverence due to the King &amp; Church, was converted unto theſe Patriots of their Countries Liberty, and New Lights: Nor could the Church relieve the Crown, (although the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors were well-affected towards it) being by all the Faction more hated, than the King became deſpiſed; until in the end the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors both of Church and State not only became Victims to the rage and luſt of ſeditious men, but the Revenues of both a prey to their ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice. And now what is left for this miſerable Nation to expect (having forfeited all Piety and Allegiance to Gods Church and his Anointed) but after all this conſumption of the Blood, and Publique and Private Revenue of the Nation, and having loſt all Reputation and Commerce abroad, for the future to be <hi>Turk-</hi>like governed by armed and hungry Soldiers, without any probable hope of Redemption.</p>

Where the Law of Nature gives a power which is not reſtrained <note place="margin">The Father hath power of life and death over his children.</note> by the Law of Nature, the power is abſolute: But it is evident, that the Law of Nature gives Fathers a power over their Children without reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Therefore the Fathers power is abſolute, and by conſequence he hath power of life and death over his Children.

Examples of the Fathers power of life and death are hard to find, becauſe it cannot eaſily be imagined a Father ſhould give judgment upon himſelf, (his ſon being part of himſelf) to cut off any part of himſelf, which he hopes might by any means be cured: Yet <hi>Quintus Fulvius</hi> did adjudge his ſon to death, for being of <hi>Catelines</hi> Conſpracie: <note place="margin">Saluſt. de conj.

                        <head>CHAP. VII. The Husbands Power.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. THe Husbands power doth not ariſe <hi>ex concubitu;</hi> for then a man hath power over all the women which he hath, or ſhall have known, which is abſurd; beſides, one woman known by ſeveral men, ſhould be alike ſubject to them all, which is impoſſible.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Husbands power does not ariſe from his Wifes being a part of his family; for any part of the family, may become no part of the family; but the Wife can never be out of the power of her Husband, therefore the Husbands power does not ariſe from the Wifes being a part of his family.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Husbands power does not ariſe from the Wifes ſubmiſſion or ſubjecting herſelf to her Husband, for that is but an act of her will, <hi>&amp; unum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quodque</hi>
                           <pb n="77" facs="tcp:200520:102"/> 
                           <hi>diſſolvi poteſt eo ligamine quo ligatum eſt;</hi> and therefore by an act of her will, ſhe may when ſhe liſt ſet herſelf free.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It does not ariſe from the Husbands accepting of the Wifes will; for that makes the Husband obedient to his Wife; obedience being no other thing, but the accepting the will of another, which is unnatural.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Husbands power does ariſe from the law of God or Nature, by <note place="margin">From whence the Huſbands power doth ariſe.</note> the conjunction of Man and Wife in wedlock: For theſe two individual perſons, by the law of God, are made one myſtical perſon, of which the Husband is head; and the head is the directive and ruling part of the body, therefore the Husband is the director and ruler of his Wife.</p>
                        <p>
                           <label>Object.</label> But if the Law of Nature, by Marriage, gives the Husband a power or right of command over the Wife; why may it not be, that God by the Civil pact might give a Prince or Court a right of command over thoſe Men who made it?</p>
                        <p>
                           <label>Anſw.</label> I anſwer, That firſt a Similitude proves nothing. Secondly, The caſes are nothing alike: For, Marriage was an inſtitution of God in Paradiſe; and the power of the Husband over the Wife, being due by the Law of Nature, hath been ever ſince attributed by Mankind to the Husband; yet ſo, that after the death of the Husband, the Wife becomes free from ſuch ſubjection, until by Marriage ſhe again ſubjects herſelf. In none of theſe reſpects does this hold in the Civil pact; for no ſuch thing was ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God, nor any ſuch thing ever conſtituted or done by Man, but only a <hi>Chimera</hi> invented by capricious men, to palliate ſedition. Nor did ever any man become free from ſubjection to Supreme powers, by the death of him or them to whom they made their ſubjection by virtue of the Civil pact: Nor was it ever known in the world, that Men were free before they made their Civil pact, as Women are before they marry.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. God gives a power to the Husband without reſtriction, <hi>viz. Thy</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The Huſband hath <hi>jus vitae &amp; necis</hi> over his Wife.</note> 
                           <hi>deſire ſhall be to thy husband, and he ſhall rule over thee, Gen.</hi> 3. 16. And therefore the Husbands power over the wife is without reſtriction, and by conſequence the Husband hath power over the life of his Wife. Antiently among the <hi>Gaules,</hi> this power was not reſtrained. The <hi>Romilian</hi> Law reſtrained the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Caeſar lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de bel. Gal.</hi>
                           </note> power to put his Wife to death, for four cauſes only. This power was uſed by the <hi>Weſt-Indians,</hi> before they were ſubdued by the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and is generally among the Idolaters and <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> But the exerciſe of the Fathers and Husbands power of life and death over their Children and Wives, is reſtrained not by any law of God (that I know of) but by the Temporal laws; and yet no wrong done to the Fathers or Husbands neither: For, though their Children and Wives be in their power by the law of Nature, yet by the law of Nature are they in the power of their Soveraign, and ſubject unto him: And though the Fathers and Husbands power be from the law of Nature, yet the exerciſe of it is humane, politick, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary; and the exerciſe of all Subjects voluntary actions, may be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and determined by him, who hath the ſupreme power; therefore the Fathers and Husbands exerciſing their power over their Children and Wives, may be reſtrained by him who commands by the higheſt right, which is the King. But ſuppoſing the Husbands and Fathers power to be from the law of Nature, and Regal power but a politick and invented thing, and made only by the will of Man; it were then a violence upon the law of Nature, that any thing which hath no origination but from the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:200520:103"/> and wills of Men, ſhould reſtrain the exerciſe of that power which God hath given Fathers and Husbands by the law of Nature.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The Husband being the head of the Wife, ſhe is in all reſpects of law <note place="margin">The Wife has nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per againſt her Husband.</note> deemed <hi>civiliter mortua,</hi> nor can take or purchaſe any thing during the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but whatſoever is given to the Wife, is <hi>ex facto</hi> the Husbands. Yet Marriage being a Sacrament by the inſtitution of our Saviour, and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25, 32. a Myſtery of Chriſt and his Church, and ſo the cogniſance thereof due to the Eccleſiaſtical power; the Church, upon the penalty of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical cenſure, may compell the Husband to allow his Wife Alimony, if without ſufficient cauſe he ſhall refuſe to cohabit with her.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. If Poligamy had not been lawful before our Saviour Chriſts time, <note place="margin">Poligamy was lawful before our Saviour,</note> then had our Saviour been illegitimate, being deſcended of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> had many other wives. Nor can the argument drawn from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of propagating Mankind, take place when <hi>David</hi> reigned; for there never was in ſo ſmall a Continent ſo great a number of people, as the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> were when <hi>David</hi> reigned, as appears by the Number which <hi>Joab</hi> took, and for which <hi>David</hi> was puniſhed with ſo great a peſtilence.</p>
                        <p>If it were, before the divine law of our Saviour, lawful every where for <note place="margin">Annot.</note> Men to have many Wives; I do wonder why Mr. <hi>Hobbs, cap.</hi> 17. <hi>art.</hi> 8. <hi>de Cive,</hi> ſays, That our Saviour made no laws but the inſtitution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> And if Matrimony be a Civil inſtitution, as he affirms, then Poligamy is lawful for all Chriſtians who are in ſubjection to the <hi>Turks, &amp;c.</hi> where by the Temporal laws it is permitted; and the Kingdom of <hi>Congo</hi> rejected Chriſtianity for no other reaſon, but becauſe they were not allowed plurality of wives, which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> could eaſily have diſpenced with. I do challenge Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> to ſhew any one inſtance, where ever in the Chriſtian world (before all things ran riot here in <hi>England</hi> ſince 1642.) the Temporal power took cogniſance of Marriage.</p>
                        <p n="9">9.

THere are three ſorts of Families; either by Affinity or Alliance, <note place="margin">How many ſorts of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies there be.</note> or by Conſanguinity, or a Legal or Houſhold-Family. Of ſuch a Family, and of its Cauſe and Juriſdiction, we ſhall in this enſuing Chapter treat.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A Family is not the cohabitation of divers perſons in one houſe; <note place="margin">A legal family is not the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation of divers perſons in the ſame houſe.</note> for then Inmates and Travellers, &amp;c. were ſubject to the power of the Maſter and Hoſt. Beſides, ſubjection cannot be, where it depends upon the will of the Subject; when he will, he may chooſe whether he will obey: But it is evident that Inmates and Travellers may, when they will, ceaſe their ſubjection by leaving of the houſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A Family is contained in the mutual offices of commanding and <note place="margin">What a legal family is.</note> obeying, of ſeveral perſons under one head, in the ſame houſe: And the ſame head may be of divers Families; as when a Maſter keeps ſervants in two or more different houſes.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A Family may conſiſt of <hi>Paterfamilias,</hi> who is Father and Husband, <note place="margin">Of what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a family (in the largeſt ſenſe) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> and the head or commanding part of the family of Wife, Children and Servants, who are the obeying part of the family; or of the Miſtreſs of the family who commands, and of Children and Servants who obey.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But becauſe a Family may conſiſt, where as parts of the Family <note place="margin">In the more proper ſenſe.</note> there is neither Father nor Mother, Husband nor Wife, nor Children; A Family is properly, where ſeveral Servants obey the ſame Maſter or Miſtreſs in the ſame houſe.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Servants are twofold, either voluntarily ſerving with their conſent <note place="margin">Of Servants.</note> firſt given; ſuch as are thoſe ſervants who for ſuch wages ſerve their Maſters
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:200520:104"/> for ſuch a terme; or where they ſerve, whether they give conſent or not, as where men are ſlaves, or apprentices. The power which the head of the family has over his Servants, is called <hi>poteſtas herilis</hi> or <hi>deſpotica,</hi> the Maſters or Miſtreſſes power. We ſpeak firſt of Maſters power over Servants ſerving for wages.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. It is impoſſible that any man can oblige or ſubject himſelf to any <note place="margin">The Maſters power does not ariſe from the Servants ſubjecting himſelf.</note> man or creature by any Act of his will, for no Act of any mans will can have any power of himſelf; <hi>Omnis potentia activa, eſt principium tranſmutandi aliud:</hi> every active power is the cauſe of alteration in another body; the Act there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a mans will, can make no obligation in his body who does will it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is againſt all rules of relation, that to bind and to be bound can be in the ſame thing; therefore it is much more abſurd to ſuppoſe the whole man ſhould be obliged by a part of himſelf, that is, by his will: Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that if a man be obliged to his will, then is the moſt wilful man, the moſt juſt man, and every man is obliged to do any thing becauſe he hath willed it, then which there is nothing can be more immoral and deſtructive to all ſociety with mankind.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. If the Maſters power did ariſe from the Servants ſubjecting himſelf to him, which is an Act of the Servants will, then an Act of the Servants <note place="margin">Nor from the Maſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting his Servants ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. <hi>Annot.</hi>
                           </note> will may have a power and obligation upon his Maſter, which is abſurd, for this makes the Maſter to obey his Servant.</p>
                        <p>Yet in uſual ſpeaking, <hi>voluntas</hi> is confounded with <hi>conatus;</hi> as wee ſay that God did accept <hi>Abrahams</hi> will for the deed, in that he was willing to have offered up his ſon <hi>Iſaac:</hi> whereas in proper ſpeaking, God did will or command <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his ſon; and <hi>Abraham</hi> did obey (that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or accept Gods will) and did endeavor, not will (for it had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and murder in <hi>Abraham</hi> to have willed without cauſe the death of <hi>Iſaac)</hi> to have done it, when God reſtrained him, and ſo God was pleaſed to accept of <hi>Abrahams</hi> endeavor to have pleaſed him: And ſo when any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant does endeavor to do his Maſters will, though he be not able to perform it, yet ought the Maſter to accept it, becauſe he does what he can (not to do any act of his own will, but) to perform an act of his Maſters.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But ſuppoſe the Declaration of the Servants will, does evade into <note place="margin">The Maſters power does not ariſe from the Servants promiſe.</note> his promiſe given to his Maſter, yet cannot the Maſters power ariſe from thence, becauſe men are obliged to the performance of their promiſes by the Law of nature only, and that Law does oblige only in Conſcience, but the Maſters power obliges to corporal puniſhment: I ſay therefore, that no Maſters power ariſing from any Act of the Servants will or promiſe, nor from the Maſters acceptance, no Regal power can ariſe from the Princes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of their Subjects ſubmiſſion; for a great family is a kingdom, and a little kingdom is a family, ſaies <hi>Tho. Hobbes, cap.</hi> 8. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>de Cive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. If the Maſters Power did ariſe from the Law of Nature, then were <note place="margin">The Maſters power does not ariſe from the Law of Nature.</note> the power of a Maſter over his ſervant eternal, and incommunicable; but the contrary of this is evident in all places of the world; for there is no place where the Power of Maſters is not only diſſolvible by the Laws, and conſents of the Maſter and Servant; but where it is not ſlavery, there the Maſters power is terminated to years, moneths, weeks, daies, or houres, &amp;c. which expiring, the relations of Maſter and Servant are diſſolved, the Maſters power therefore is not from the Law of Nature.</p>
                        <p n="11">
                           <pb n="81" facs="tcp:200520:104"/> 11. If the Maſters power did ariſe from Divine poſitive inſtitution, <note place="margin">Nor by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine poſitive inſtitution.</note> then, where Gods revelation of himſelf in the Scriptures is not received and believed, have Maſters no power over their Servants. But this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe; for not only before Gods revelation of himſelf in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, had Maſters every where power or dominion over their Servants, but alſo every where in the world Maſters have power over their Servants, as well where the Scriptures are not received, as where they are: The Maſters power therefore does not ariſe from Divine poſitive inſtitution.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. <hi>Naſcitur ſervus,</hi> ſays <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> moſt truly: There was no man that <note place="margin">From whence the Maſters power does ariſe.</note> was ever born in the world (unleſs a poſthumous King) but was born in a threefold ſubjection; firſt to the Laws of God, ſecondly to the Laws of his Parents, and thirdly to the Laws of his Country: And the Laws of every Country obliging men to the performance of their pacts and contracts, the Law of the place is the efficient cauſe, by the Contract of the Maſter and Servant (being the inſtrumental cauſes) of the Maſters power; and not only gives the Maſter a power over his Servant, but alſo obliges the Maſter to perform all his promiſes ſpecified in the Contract to his Servant.</p>
                        <p>It is evident therefore, that where there is no precedent Humane Law <note place="margin">Annot.</note> obliging, there cannot be any Family; for, the Law, by the Maſters Contract with his Servant, gives him the power over his Servant. All <hi>Grotius</hi> his Government then, founded upon the Contracts of Men, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly falſe, and by conſequence no one true Propoſition can follow from thence. Yet truly, it is an error pardonable in him, who with his firſt milk ſucked in this Popular principle: No queſtion but he was a man as eminent in Humane learning, as any man of this laſt Age, and I doubt not but of a ſincere and peaceable diſpoſition. It is the excellency of Truth, that it is plain and eaſie to be perceived; whereas Falſhood, with all art and learning, is rendred more obſcure, by how much more is added to it. And it is ſtrange for a ſtander by to ſee what monſtrous abſurdities <hi>Grotius</hi> runs into, to uphold his fabrick: For he makes God, at the Creation and Flood, <note place="margin">

                        <p>But Mr. <hi>Hobbs, cap.</hi> 2. <hi>art.</hi> 9. makes a Contract the act of two or more <note place="margin">

Indeed, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is, no queſtion, a man of moſt exquiſite parts and learning, and poſſibly might have a peaceable intention in making the <hi>Civitas</hi> the Judge of all matters of faith as well as manners: But ſure, many things in his generation of it can never conſiſt; as his making <hi>Jus</hi> and <hi>Lex</hi> contrary one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; his making the Legiſlator to depend upon the Citizen, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent and proper pact either expreſs or underſtood, the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative

But for our Author <hi>Tho. White</hi> Gent. he is not worthy the name of a learned, rational, nor honeſt man.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Slaves are born, or made ſo. Slaves born, are the children of ſuch <note place="margin">Slaves.</note> as were ſo. Slaves made ſo, happen two ways: For being condemned for ſome crime committed againſt ſome humane Law, and therefore by the <note place="margin">Condemned perſons.</note> Law condemned to it. Where the Law condemns, it is the will of the Supreme power which condemns, and therefore not the will of the Slave that makes it ſo: I deny therefore that where the Law does not make Slavery, any man can make himſelf a ſlave to another; nor can any man uſe another as a Slave, where he is not made ſo by Law.</p>
                        <p>Or elſe, Slaves are Priſoners taken in War. There is no man will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <note place="margin">Priſoners by War.</note> the taking of another man priſoner, gives the taker a power over the others life; for then all men falling into the hands of Thieves and Pirates, the Thieves and Pirates have a power over their lives, and ſo commit no murder in putting them to death: But Slaves from being made Priſoners, is, when there is competition between two Supreme powers, and they give their Subjects power over all their Enemies which they ſhall take Priſoners. It is not therefore the taking of another Priſoner, which gives a man power over anothers life, but a precedent humane Law which gives this power over thoſe Enemies, which any Subject ſhall take Priſoner, (and ſure no man was ever taken Priſoner by an act of his will.) It is falſe therefore that <hi>Bodin</hi> ſays, <hi>That a man may make himſelf a Slave of his own accord,</hi>

It will therefore follow that either God hath left a Power which may interpret Scripture, or elſe that God hath revealed himſelf to Men without ſenſe or meaning; but the latter of theſe is moſt falſe and blaſphemous, therefore it is true that God hath left a power upon earth which may interpret the Scriptures.</p>

But it is far otherwiſe with the Scriptures, for there is no Scripture which is not of like Authority with any other, every Scripture being the Word of God; one place of Scripture therefore cannot be interpreted by the conſequents which may follow from another, any more then the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents which follow from<hi>—Quae eidem ſunt aequalia, inter ſe ſunt aequalia,</hi> may be interpreted by <hi>Omne totum eſt majus ſua parte.</hi>

It is not therefore every one, who can tranſlate the Scripture out of one language into another, with his own private conceptions upon them, which renders them to be interpreted by him. What then? hath God revealed himſelf to mankind in general without ſenſe or meaning? No, it does not follow; for as in temporal Laws, no man can interpret them but he that made them, either by himſelf or them whom he ſhall conſtitute, yet every man may by his reaſon and diſcourſe direct his own actions in conformity to thoſe Laws; but if he ſhall do any act upon miſconſtruction or interpretation of his own, his miſtaking the meaning of the Law ſhall not excuſe him: So private men may endeavor to direct their actions accordingly as they ſuppoſe God hath directed them in the Scriptures, yet if upon their own heads they undertake to interpret the Scriptures (although in order only to their own actions) their miſunderſtanding the Scriptures, ſhall never excuſe any unjuſt act.</p>

And this King <hi>James</hi> confeſſed, as you may read in <hi>Spotſwoods</hi> Hiſtory, <hi>p.</hi> 514. And if Kings by becoming Chriſtian, have ghoſtly power, then is the power left by our Saviour to his Church, not only weakned by Kings being converted to Chriſtianity, but alſo divided, which is abſurd. But if <hi>Solomon</hi> his offering a peace-offering for the people, and his bleſſing the people, be objected; I anſwer, it does ſignifie no more then a fathers bleſſing his children, and praying to God that they may live peaceably: But none of the Kings did ever offer a ſin-offering or burn incenſe to the Lord, without reprehenſion by God.</p>
                        <p>Out of this it is evident, that God never forſook men, before they <label type="milestone">

I am confident that (where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion was not made by Popular rage and uſurpation) ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world, God did ſcarce ever leave men ſo deſtitute, but they were morally certain to whom they did owe their Topical and Natural obedience.</p>

It is ſufficient that Subjects pay their obedience to him, againſt whoſe title no juſt or ſuperior title can be taken. Yet is not this ſubjection always to be underſtood of active ſubjection; For no man is bound (Government being intended for mans preſervation, not deſtruction) actually, ſo to ſubmit to rightful Governors, that he be morally certain of deſtruction therefore: Yet ought every man rather to ſuffer death, then actually to renounce or reſiſt rightful Governors, to whom by the Law of Nature they owe obedience.</p>

But ſuppoſe there be ſuch a ſucceſſion from an Uſurper, that not only the Heir to the Uſurper, but all men in his Government were born Subjects to him and his Anceſtors from whom he is deſcended; as in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 6. when all men were born either in ſubjection to him, his Father or Grandfather, (who had no colour or title to the Crown) whether in ſuch caſe may Subjects ſo born aſſiſt ſuch a Prince againſt the right Heir? I ſay, I pray God avert the like from ever being again in the Engliſh Nation! 'Tis true, the right Heir hath a juſt title of war againſt ſuch a Prince: but whether Subjects ſo born (their being ſo born, being no act of their will, but was cauſed by a higher cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the will of God) may actually aſſiſt him to whom they were ſo born in ſubjection, againſt him who hath the ſuperior title, I leave to God and mens conſciences.</p>

But this <hi>Quaere</hi> can only have reference to Subjects who are born <note place="margin">Diverſity.</note> in Hereditary Monarchies; for in Ariſtocracies and Democracies there neither is, or ever was any original right or power in them, but their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions do neceſſarily depend upon an antecedent act of them, or the major part of them, to meet at a certain time and place. Where therefore ſuch Aſſemblies are diſſolved <hi>ſine die,</hi> they are totally diſſolved, however this diſſolution happens; nor does any man owe them obedience any longer, but his or their title who next poſſeſſeth, is good enough againſt them and all others who cannot make a ſuperior or more juſt claim. Nor can this have any reference to men born in Elective Monarchies; for, the Election depending upon the wills of men, <hi>viz.</hi> the Electors, (who originally had no right of Election) any Poſſeſſion brought in againſt ſuch Election by the will of man, is title equivalent to it; nor do Subjects in conſcience owe obedience but to him who is poſſeſt, or can make a ſuperior claim by a true deſcent from him againſt whom no juſt title can be taken.</p>

And determines for the former; and the reaſon he gives, is, That Laws, be they never ſo many, are finite, but mens actions are infinite; and therefore though never ſo many Laws be made, yet may men find evaſions out of them to abuſe and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:200520:112"/> wrong other men, whereby this multiplicity of Laws will rather enſnare other men, than avoid the end for which they were intended. It is a folly much incident to <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> that they place not only Freedom in ſerving many Maſters, but Liberty in many Laws. Let any man take a ſurvey of the Statute-Laws and Ordinances made ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth his diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Monaſteries, to this year 1660. and ſee if they be not four times more than all the Acts made before, only to the liberty of the Lawyers Fees, for the enſnaring of the Subjects; it being no doubt the greateſt liberty of the Subject to be governed by few Laws, and theſe the ſame in all places, if it were poſſible.</p>

                        <p>So that Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> ſeems to be of opinion, that the Common-Law had its origination from King <hi>Alured</hi> or <hi>Alfred,</hi> who was King of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and a moſt victorious, pious, prudent, and glorious Monarch; about the year of our Lord 890. And from a moſt deplorable condition, by reaſon of the Daniſh invaſion and robbery, reduced it to a moſt quiet calm, and laid that foundation, upon which the body of the Common-Law is ſince builded. But whoſoever was the firſt Founder and Eſtabliſher of them, certain it is they were antient, and Laws which better ſuit to the nature and diſpoſition of <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> then any other that are, or ever were in the world, would do.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As thoſe general Uſages or Cuſtoms which are generally obſerved, <note place="margin">Particular Uſages.</note> are called the Common-Law; ſo there are almoſt infinite particular Uſages, Preſcriptions and Cuſtoms in ſeveral parts of this Nation, which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as Laws by the Inhabitants of thoſe places, and to all intents and purpoſes have the effect of Laws.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Statute-Laws are Acts of Parliament, which are neither general <note place="margin">Statute-Law.</note> nor particular Cuſtoms, but are Laws made by the Kings of this Land in Parliament, upon ſundry and diverſe occaſions, according to the then occaſions, as they repreſented themſelves. For although all innovations are dangerous; and therefore if it were poſſible, no doubt it were beſt that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws (as the Laws of Nature) might be immutable and eternal; but as God hath created all things tranſitory, and nothing in this world the ſame the next ſubſequent minute, that it was before; and therefore the ſtate of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:200520:118"/> Humane affairs being every day variable, and putting on a new face to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which they had not neither to day, nor yeſterday; which cannot be certainly foreſeen by any man, or men, no more then any Maſter of a Ship can foreſee what winds will blow to morrow, or next day; or whether it will be ſerene, or ſtormy weather, whether deep or Rockey Seas. Yet if no prudent Mariner will venture himſelf, and thoſe under his command to Sea, without ſufficient proviſion againſt all the contingencies which may happen, and be prevented; Then ſure no man or men not vainly blinded with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, will undertake to manage the Government of a Nation without ſufficient means to protect themſelves and Subjects from all future ſtorms and confuſions, which may either ariſe from within the Nation, or be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from without. Yet will it not follow that every day there ſhould be new Laws made, for <hi>Nihil ſemel perfectum &amp; inventum,</hi> there is nothing which is perfect ſo ſoon as begun; and many miſchiefs and inconveniencies may be begun, and yet be prevented before they can be brought to perfection. But then it muſt be preſuppoſed that there may be remedies uſed, which muſt of neceſſity be, that there be a preſent and coercive power in being, which may ſuppreſs, and diſſolve thoſe miſchiefes and inconveniences, by making new Laws, if the old ones will not remedy them; and this is no new thing, but is, and alwaies was, in all governments that ever were, whether Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, or Democracy.</p>
                        <p>A Parliament is a Politick body compounded of Heterogenial or <note place="margin">Of what parts a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is compounded. <hi>Inſt.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 1.</note> diſſimilar parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the King, the Lords ſpiritual and temporal, in one diſtinct houſe, and of a houſe of Commons another diſtinct houſe.</p>
                        <p>Since there has been ſo much conteſt about the power and juriſdiction <note place="margin">What creates the Lords houſe.</note> and cauſe of Parliament; and ſince it being compounded of unlike parts, and ſome of theſe unlike parts, nay pieces of thoſe parts have aſſumed the name of Parliament, We will examine all the parts of it, and ſee whether it be not all made and created by the King, and into him only can be ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately reſolved, he being <hi>principium, caput, &amp; finis</hi> of it.</p>

                        <p>But ſince there is ſo much conteſt about the Houſe of Commons, and <note place="margin">The Houſe of Commons are not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the Free people of the Nation.</note> men ſay they repreſent the Freeborn people of this Nation, and are the Supreme Authority of the Nation: We will therefore enquire into the cauſe, and ſee what may be the Freeborn people; and whether a Houſe of Commons, as it now ſtands, can be their Repreſentative; and whether being their Repreſentative, they may be the Supreme Authority of this Nation?</p>
                        <p>Firſt, What are the People? If any man had ſaid the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the people of <hi>Athens,</hi> or the people of <hi>Carthage, &amp;c.</hi> a man had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them, and only them of <hi>Rome, Athens,</hi> or <hi>Carthage, &amp;c.</hi> who were <hi>civitate donati.</hi> But in <hi>England</hi> the caſe is much otherwiſe; for with us there is no <hi>civitate donatus</hi> in one more then another, but all men are alike born free, and ſo by conſequence every man as a freeborn man of <hi>England</hi> has as much right to his freedom one man as another. I ſay therefore, if every man of <hi>England</hi> has not a like vote and power in electing Members for the Houſe of Commons, then cannot the Houſe of Commons be the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the Nation; for, <hi>Plus valet contemptus unius, quâm conſenſus omnium.</hi> But it is moſt manifeſtly evident, that the Houſe of Commons are not elected by the equal conſent of the freeborn people of <hi>England,</hi> (for not only two parts of three have not Forty ſhillings a year, yet are as freeborn as they who have, and as liable to penalty for tranſgreſſing Laws made in Parliament, as they who do elect; but many men have double votes in the election, in Corporations where they ſend Burgeſſes, and yet have like power with the Forty-ſhillings-men in electing a Knight of the Shire; and ſuch a place as <hi>Riſing-Chaſe</hi> and <hi>Old Sarum, &amp;c.</hi> have a like power in this Houſe with the County of <hi>York;</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham</hi> ſends none at all: So that it may be rather termed a Repreſentative of the Free Corporations, then a Repreſentative of the Freeborn people of <hi>England.)</hi> The Houſe of Commons therefore cannot be a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Freeborn people of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But ſuppoſe them the Repreſentatives of the Freeborn people of this <note place="margin">Nor the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Nation.</note> Nation, yet cannot they be the Supreme Authority of it; for no power can act beyond the power of its being. I ſay therefore, that no Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive can be ſupreme, or ſuperior to the cauſe of its being: The Houſe of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:200520:119"/> Commons therefore cannot be (granting it the Repreſentative of the Freeborn people of this Nation) the Supreme Authority of the Nation.</p>
                        <p>But if the houſe of Commons be not ſent by the people and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives; Who creates them, and by what right do they make a houſe of Commons?</p>
                        <p>Before we anſwer this <hi>Quaere,</hi> wee will ſee of what ſorts of men a houſe <note place="margin">Of what ſorts of men the houſe of Commons is compounded.</note> of Commons is compounded. A houſe of Commons is compounded of three ſorts of men, <hi>viz.</hi> Knights of Counties, Citizens ſent by Cities, and Burgeſſes of Corporations: Barons of the Cinque Ports are the ſame thing differently expreſſed with Burgeſſes of Corporations. Now that all Cities, Burroughs, Corporations, and Cinque Ports, are not ſo <hi>jure naturali,</hi> nor by any inherent birthright, but from their Charter, which is nothing elſe but the Kings grant, is ſo manifeſt, that I think no man in his wits will deny. But all Cities and Corporations are not alike in priviledges, but more or leſs as they are impowred by their Charter or Grant of the King. Some Corporations have Liberties &amp; Priviledges, and are impowred to ſend Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes; others have Liberties and Priviledges, but not qualified to ſend Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes; nay ſome Cities have Liberties and Priviledges, but not endewed with this right of having Repreſentative in the houſe of Commons, as the Cities of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Ely.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as neither Cities nor Burroughs are endewed with theſe their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties <note place="margin">What creates the houſe of Commons.</note> and Priviledges by any inherent birthright; ſo neither are the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties nor Inhabitants endewed with any right of ſending Knights of their Counties by any inherent birthright; for then had all the Counties a like right one as another, and all the Inhabitans a like vote; and they mighr create repreſentatives as often as they ſhould ſee occaſion. But all theſe are moſt evidently falſe; for we have ſhewed before, that not only the diviſion of this Nation into Counties was an act of the Kings, but all Counties are not alike endewed with this Priviledge, ſome Counties in <hi>Wales</hi> ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one, and the County of <hi>Durham</hi> none at all. Nor have all men a like vote in electing (and yet as much ſubject to Laws made in Parliament as other men) but men only who have 40 <hi>s.</hi> yearly freehold rent; nor can theſe 40 <hi>s.</hi> a year men, when they will, ſend their repreſentatives. What then does impower theſe to ſend repreſentatives? Why let <hi>Sir Ed. Coke</hi> ſay, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Inſt.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 1.</note> Knights of Shires, Citizens of Cities, and Burgeſſes of Burroughs, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively elected by the Counties, Cities and Burroughs, by force of the Kings Writ. So that the Kings Writ is the firſt and efficient cauſe of the <note place="margin">
                              <hi>pag.</hi> 28.</note> houſe of Commons, as well of the Knights, as Citizens and Burgeſſes; the Commons cannot begin nor be diſſolved, without the King in perſon or repreſentation.</p>
                        <p>If then Rebellion be as the ſin of Witchcraft, as the Holy Ghoſt ſaies; <note place="margin">Annot.</note> and if <hi>crimen leſae Majeſtatis</hi> be the higheſt crime and impiety, as all Lawyers hold; and if Gratitude be one the chief of all Moral virtues, as all men hold, for, <hi>ſi ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris,</hi> no man who is an ingrateful man, but has rendred himſelf as if he had committed all manner of wickedneſs: How impious then is it for men, only from the Kings grace endewed with this high favor, to convert it in oppoſition and derogation of that power and perſon from whence they originally received it! But they ſay, if the Commons did it, then was it done by the people, and ſo juſt and not to be queſtioned,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:200520:119"/> as if the people were not a thing to be governed; and all as much ſubject to the King and Laws as every one; or that a thing juſt or unjuſt in it ſelf, were more juſt or unjuſt, becauſe more or fewer did it. Will any man ſay, the crucifying of our Saviour was therefore juſt, becauſe many of the <hi>Jews</hi> did it? or that a rout or riot is therefore lawful, becauſe done by many men? or that it is not paricide or regicide, if many Sons and Subjects kill their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and King?</p>
                        <p>As all the Members of both houſes are created by the King, ſo cannot <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot begin but by the King.</note> theſe Members be formed into a body but by the King, either by his Royal preſence or repreſentation. By repreſentation two waies; either by a Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of <hi>England</hi> by Letters Patents under the great Seal, when the King is <hi>in remotis</hi> out of the Realm: or by Commiſſion under the great Seal of <note place="margin">

                           <hi>England</hi> to certain Lords of Parliament repreſenting the perſon of the King, he being within the Realm, in reſpect of ſome infirmity.</p>
                        <p>This Houſe is ſo far from being the Supreme Authority of the Nation, <note place="margin">The Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Commons Houſe.</note> that they are not a Court of Judicature, nor can impoſe an Oath, or take any mans Examination. Yet Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi> ſays, <hi>Inſt.</hi> 4. 28. that the Houſe of Commons is to many purpoſes a diſtinct Court, becauſe (he ſays) they cannot be prorogued or adjourned but by its ſelf; yet gives no more. It is true indeed, that to many purpoſes among themſelves they do judge their Members, and Elections, and have a Committee for Religion; but theſe things are more of cuſtom (whether good or bad, I cannot tell) then of any original right that I know, or ever heard of. And Sir <hi>Ed. Coke, Inſt.</hi> 4. 11. ſays, They being the general Inquiſitors of the Realm, have principal care in the beginning of Parliaments to appoint Committees of Grievances (both in Church and Commonwealth) of Courts of Juſtice, of Priviledges, and of Advancement of Trade. They have been wont too, ever ſince the Statute <hi>de Tallagie non concedendo,</hi> of courſe to grant the King Aids in extraordinary caſes.</p>
                        <p>The Houſe of Peers, aſſiſted as aforeſaid, are the Supreme Court of <note place="margin">The Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Houſe of Lords.</note> Judicature in this Nation; not only to judge whether matters preſented to them by the Commons, be fit or requiſite for the King to paſs into Laws, (as Monſieur <hi>Bodin</hi> well obſerves, who diſputes this better then any of our Engliſh Lawyers that I know of, has done) but alſo of Writs of Error, and of matters of Fact either not determinable in other Courts, or elſe when though they are determinable in other Courts, yet in regard of nicety or ſpecial matter they cannot well diſcern or judge.</p>
                        <p>I have therefore been particular herein, as well to ſhew into what cauſe <note place="margin">Annot.</note> not only both Houſes conjunctly, but every particular Member in either, have a right of being; as alſo (ſince <hi>Non datur progreſſus ad infinitum)</hi> the Parliament being a body compounded of heterogenial or diſſimilar parts, if they ſever or divide, into what Subjects may, ultimately with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, reſolve their faith and obedience. And no queſtion, it is better any thing ſhould be Law, then that every thing ſhould be lawful: And that is the greateſt ſlavery, where Subjects know not where to pay their obedience, and from whence to expect protection; but where different Factions ſhall with equal right or injury, impoſe their luſts and wills for Laws to their Fellow-ſubjects.</p>

                        <p>To the firſt I ſay, Kings reign by a higher then any humane law; and <label type="milestone">

In <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. his time, the Commons got to have their aſſent, as well
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:200520:122"/> as the Lords in paſſing Laws. And this manner of paſſing Laws continued generally until <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, where they were ſometime made by the King, with the aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament, and ſometime by the Parliament: But the form of enacting Laws by the King, and the Lords Spiritual, Temporal, and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, was ſeldom or never uſed before Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time.</p>
                        <p>So that it is as clear as the Sun at noon-day, That a King of <hi>England,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Seſſions of Parliaments, do not dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power.</note> by the ancient uſages of this Nation, is as free and abſolute in the Seſſion of Parliament, as out. And the Act of a King in Parliament, is the free and voluntary Act of an abſolute Monarch; for the Act of the King in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament paſſed by the aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and at the Petition of the Commons, is not leſs the act of the King, becauſe it is ſo paſſed; unleſs a man will deny, that my Will being a faculty of my Soul, cannot imperate an act, if it takes information from my Underſtanding or Reaſon; Reaſon and Underſtanding being in proportion to the Will, as Counſel is to a Law. King <hi>Charles</hi> of Sacred memory, commends to his Son, the then Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> in his laſt Letter and Admonition to him (though for his own particular he had little Reaſon (God knows) ſo to do) the frequent uſe of Parliaments, as the beſt means, by which, Laws may be received of the Subjects, and diffuſed to all parts of the Nation, and to hold a right underſtanding between the King, and his Subjects.</p>
                        <p>But as <hi>nullum medicamentum eſt idem omnibus;</hi> nay, the ſame Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine at one time may kill the ſame perſon, which at another time may cure him: And that thing, which at one time may be a very probable reaſon of an action, at another time, may be none at all, or quite contrary to Reaſon: So in Reaſons of State, that may be a very probable reaſon at one time, which may be none at all, or perhaps deſtructive at another time. As <hi>Henry</hi> the Third had great Reaſon of State, to form a Houſe of Commons, and endue it with large priviledges, to ſecure himſelf againſt a ſtubborn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Nobility: But King <hi>Charles</hi> had not the ſame Reaſon of State to indulge the Houſe of Commons, contriving the deſtruction of himſelf, the Church and Nobility, Laws and Liberties of this Nation. <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt had great Reaſon of State to call a Parliament, and to paſs the Act <hi>De Tallagio non concedendo,</hi> for otherwiſe as the ſtate of affairs then ſtood, he could neither get money to aſſiſt his Friend and Ally, the Earl of <hi>Flanders;</hi> nor relieve his diſtreſſed Subjects in <hi>Aquitaine</hi> oppreſſed by the French King (which Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in his Comment upon this Statute obſerves;) but King <hi>Charles</hi> had not the ſame Reaſon of State, to call the Parliament in 1640. who (inſtead of aſſiſting their natural Sovereign againſt a Rebellious Rabble of Mungrel <hi>Hebrides</hi> and <hi>Lyſisks,</hi> give them Three hundred thouſand pounds to be exported out of the Kingdom for their Brotherly aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt had great Reaſon of State to paſs the Statute of <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> when as men were ſo ſuperſtitiouſly given, that no man thought he could merit Heaven, if he gave nothing to the Church; whereby ſuch large Revenues accrued to the Church, that the third part of the Revenues of the Nation was in Church-mens hands; who pretending exemption from the Temporal Power, if ſome remedy were not taken, the King would probably be left deſtitute of means to protect himſelf, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:200520:122"/> yet is there not now that Reaſon of State, when in a Sacrilegious age, all the Patrimony of the Church goes to wrack and ruine; and men of Badges of Sacriledge, make marks of Saintſhip. It were endleſs to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate how Reaſons of State vary with the times: It muſt ſuffice, that there be means always in the Supream Power, to remedy and cure the maladies and miſchiefs of State, as they ariſe and repreſent themſelves. Yet it is a remarkable thing, That they who oblige Kings and Supream Powers to their own Laws, will never be obliged by either their own, or any Laws of God, if ever the Supremacy comes to be veſted in them; and let any man ſhew me in Five hundred years one time, wherein the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did alter the Laws out of Parliament, and I will ſhew him an hundred times in ſeven years, where men arrogating to themſelves the name of Parliament, have altered the Laws without the King. They who oblige Supream Powers to Humane Laws, the Conditions muſt oblige God too to ſuch things, as is contained in thoſe Laws and Conditions, or elſe it is impoſſible for Powers to protect their Subjects.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Corruptio optimi eſt peſsima,</hi> there were never ſo vile things done as have been by Parliaments, or by men calling themſelves ſo. Sir <hi>Edward</hi>

                        <p>The Parliament in the Firſt of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third his Reign (though a bloody Uſurper) preſented a Bill for the entailing the Crown upon his Heirs. <note place="margin">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:200520:123"/> upon <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and the Heirs of his body, (he having no colour of title to it, but in right of his Wife) and becauſe he ſuſpected his title, and reigned in his own right to the wrong of his Wife, and after her deceaſe, to the wrong of his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, in the eleventh year of his Reign, he got an Act of Parliament to paſs, which ſhould protect all Subjects who ſhould aſſiſt the King (be he ſo by right, or not) for the time being. So that other offences ſhould be puniſhed; but he that perpetrates the higheſt villany by invading a Crown, ſhould be protected by Law. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, by authority of Parliament, <hi>an.</hi> 1533.

                        <p>Add hereunto the ridiculous, yet cruel Act of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8 his Headſhip of the Church: So that a ſtranger being one day in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and ſeeing one burnt for denying the Six Articles, and another hanged for denying his Headſhip, cried out, <hi>Bone Deus, quo modo hic agunt vivi! hic combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtur Papistae, ibi ſuſpenduntur Antipapistae.</hi> The bloody Laws paſſed in Parliament in proſecution of the Six Articles, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. and the bloody Parliamentary Laws for Religion, in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> reign, &amp;c. and all thoſe Sacrilegious Acts made in the reigns of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. and ſure no man can imagine ſuch horrid acts could be perpetrated but by Parliaments.</p>
                        <p>Nor have the General Aſſemblies in <hi>France</hi> (who were wont to be aſſembled once or twice a year) demeaned themſelves much better then the Parliaments in <hi>England;</hi> but in ſtead of providing good Laws, fell into ſuch Factions, and uſed ſuch affronts to the Regal power, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh (a moſt ſubtile and cunning Prince) was wont to ſay, It was time to put the French Kings, <hi>horce de page,</hi> out of their minority, and from being Pages any more; and ſo he did. And ſince his time they have been rarely convented in <hi>France:</hi> For ſince the General Aſſembly at <hi>Bloys, anno</hi> 1587. by <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, where the famous Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was killed, there hath been but one, <hi>anno</hi> 1614. in the fourth year of the reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth; and that ſucceeded ſo ilfavoredly, that there is no probability of ever being another.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Beſides the general and particular Cuſtoms, and Acts of Parliament, there are almoſt infinite Corporations, Colledges and Companies, who have divers and ſundry priviledges, which are granted by the Kings Letters Patents, and are obſerved as Laws, and to all intents and purpoſes have the effect of Laws.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But in all Maritime caſes, (the Kings of <hi>England</hi> being Soveraigns of the Narrow Seas, whatſoever <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays to the contrary) and all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done upon a Navigable river, are judged by the courſe of Civil law; and ſo the Probate of Wills, and Letters of Adminiſtration are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by the Civil law.</p>
                        <p>Judge <hi>Jenkins,</hi> a learned Gentleman, and a ſtout Champion for the Laws of this Nation, in the firſt page of his <hi>Lex terrae,</hi> divides the Laws of this Nation into three grounds or ſpecies, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Cuſtoms, 2. Acts of Parliaments, and 3. Judicial Records; and that the two latter are declarations of the former touching Royal government; ſo that he makes Cuſtom to be the ground of Royal government, and Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to have but a declaratory power of the Common Law touching
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:200520:123"/> Royal government, and Judicial Records to be equivalent to Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. In all which he is moſt manifeſtly miſtaken: For firſt, there are an exceeding many Acts of Parliament, which have no manner of dependence or affinity with the Common-Law, and ſo cannot be declarations of it; nay, there are many Acts of Parliament which are ſo far from being decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Common-Law, that they do annihilate it, and create other things in lieu thereof; as the Statute of <hi>West.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. called the Statute <hi>de donis conditionalibus,</hi> annihilated all the Conditional eſtates in Fee at Common-Law, and created eſtates in Tail in lieu thereof. At Common-Law, no Lands or Tenemers were deviſeable by Will; but the Acts of 32 &amp; 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. create a power of deviſing Lands and Tenements in Fee, by Will; and Tenants at Common-Law might chooſe whether they would attorn to any Grant of the Lord; but now the Lords Grant is good without it, by 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. Sir <hi>Ed. Coke com. on Lit. ſect.</hi> 574. ſays, <hi>Stat.</hi> 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. takes away the reaſon of the Common-Law; ſo that, that cannot be a declaration of what, it takes away the reaſon.</p>
                        <p>It were tedious to inſtance the Acts of Parliament which give one Jointenant a power to compell the others to ſue a Writ of Partition, which was denied at Common-Law; and right of Entry, where they were put to their <hi>Cui in vita, &amp;c.</hi> It may ſuffice, that in no Kings reign there have not been Acts of Parliament, which have been ſo far from making declarations of the Common-Law, that they have made manifeſt alterations in it. And as the Common-Law hath no force nor reaſon againſt an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo hath no particular Cuſtom any force or reaſon againſt it, for no man can preſcribe againſt an Act of Parliament; and all Lands in Gavel-kind were particular Cuſtoms, but taken away by Act of Parliament. And many Acts of Parliament have not declared the Succeſſion of the Engliſh Diadem according to the uſual cuſtom thereof, but made manifeſt alteration thereof, as in the Succeſſion of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 5. &amp; 6. <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. &amp; 8. which being unjuſt, and the cauſe not depending upon Humane laws, ought not to be obeyed.</p>
                        <p>Nor (ſecondly) is that a leſs error, that Judicial Records are equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to Acts of Parliament; for they are ſo far from being equal to Acts of Parliament, that in truth they are no Laws, but Inferences and Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which are deduced from Laws. For there is not any Judicial Record, which is not unjuſt, if it cannot truly and ultimately be reſolved in ſome general or particular Cuſtom, Act of the Parliament, or grant of the King. So that Acts of Parliament, the Common Law, Particular Cuſtoms and Preſcriptions, and Royal Grants, are as Axioms, <hi>Poſtulata,</hi> or Principles in Arts or Sciences; and Judicial Records, Reported Caſes, and Years<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books, are Inferences, Concluſions, or Sciences deduced from Acts of Parliament, the Common Law, and particular Cuſtoms of this Land, or Conceſſions of the King.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Touching Royal Government;</hi> Royal Government being the ordinance of God, and from the Law of Nature, is paramount to all Humane laws, and the prime and efficient cauſe of them; they cannot therefore declare the cauſe, ſo as to create any obligation, of what they are but the effects, and from whence derived.</p>
                        <p>We have thus far treated of the means by which the Kings of this Nation have (until 1640.) governed and preſerved their Subjects inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:200520:124"/> But becauſe it is the office of Kings, to preſerve their Subjects as well from foreign force, as internal broil; there is yet ſomething wanting, of which we have not treated, <hi>viz.</hi> The power of making War and Peace, and maintaining Alliance and Traffique. Of theſe, in regard they refer to Foreign powers and juriſdictions, and are not ſubject to the Laws of the Nation, we ſhall forbear to treat; only affirming that it is neceſſary that at all times this power muſt be ſo veſted in the King, that at all times he may have the aids and aſſiſtance of his Subjects in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Ends aforeſaid.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Juſtice is the upright doing of an act conſerving Society, in that <note place="margin">Quid ſit Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note> formality as it is commanded, or permitted by him, who by right may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or permit it. Juſtice is the doing of a juſt action; the doing of a juſt action, is the upright doing of any act, as it is commanded or permitted by him, who by right may command or permit it, preſerving Peace and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. I ſay, Juſtice muſt have theſe two properties, <hi>viz.</hi> upright doing (that is, abſtraction from all affections of love, hate, or ſelf-intereſt) and the Law or Command of him, who by right may command or permit ſuch an act: Other actions proceeding from Wiſdom, Reaſon, Experiment, or Diſcourſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are prudent, profitable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but none are juſt, or honeſt actions, which cannot be truly and ultimately reſolved into the Law or
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:200520:125"/> Command of him, who by right may command, or permit ſuch an act. So <note place="margin">Quotuplex.</note> that Juſtice is twofold, either commanded or permitted.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Injuſtice is the abuſe or falſifying the Law or Command of him, <note place="margin">What is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</note> who by right commands, to the hurt or prejudice of another. As a Law preceding and Integrity, are inſeparable incidents to Juſtice; ſo Hypocracy, ſeeming juſt, and yet abuſing or falſifying a Law, and the damage of another or more, are incidents inſeparable to injuſtice.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Let us ſee who may by right command, and who are obliged to do <note place="margin">God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands by higheſt right.</note> in conformity to their Laws and Commands. I ſay, God by higheſt right ought to command all the created things in Heaven and Earth; and all Creatures are chiefly and abſolutely obliged to do whatſoever he commands, without any reaſoning or diſputing why he ſo commands; <hi>For the earth is</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pſal. 24. 1. Job 41. 11. Pſal. 50. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>the Lords, and all that therein is; the compaſs of the World, and all that dwell therein: And whatſoever is under the whole Heaven, is Gods; and the World is mine, and the fulneſs thereof.</hi> All Gods commands therefore have a like and equal influence upon all his Creatures; all Creatures, as compared to him, are alike vile, and between him and them is no proportion. To abuſe then or falſifie any Law of God or Nature, to the hurt or prejudice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is a ſin of injuſtice in all Gods Creatures; and therefore in all men, and therefore in all ſorts of men: As if any man promiſes another, that he will do, or give him ſuch a thing, although it be to his hinderance, he wilfully breaks his promiſe. I ſay, this is a ſin of injuſtice in the promiſer; for he abuſes and falſifies the Law of Nature, which obliges every man to the performance of his promiſe, to his hinderance, to whom he made his promiſe. And though this be the Law of Nature which does onely oblige in Conſcience, yet is ſuch a promiſer an unjuſt man, nor does he deſerve to be truſted as a friend, or honeſt man.</p>
                        <p>But this muſt always be underſtood of private men, and they not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged <note place="margin">Annot.</note> before, for the firſt promiſe is to be performed: Neither muſt the performance of a private mans promiſe, be to the hurt or damage of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man; for by the Law of Nature he was obliged to hurt no man, and to give to every man his due, before he made ſuch promiſe. A publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon promiſes to another, to do or give him ſuch a thing which will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to his truſt, I ſay he ought not to perform it; for he was obliged to perform his truſt, before he made ſuch promiſe. What then, does preengage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the not injuring of another, or publick employment, free men and let them looſe from all Law of God and Nature? I anſwer, nothing leſs, for they ſin not leſs then private freemen, in not performing their promiſe, but commit a greater ſin in breaking their firſt promiſe, and betraying their publick truſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then if they ſhould perform their promiſe: So that in promiſing they ſin, but in the performance they commit a greater ſin.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. A King promiſeth he will not hurt any of his Subjects in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <note place="margin">How Kings promiſes are to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted and performed.</note> or eſtates, without due Proceſs, and after judgment given according to the known Laws. He being a King, was obliged as King to do to the beſt of his power, all things in order to the good and preſervation of his ſubjects in general; and therefore is obliged to this latter promiſe onely, as it is conſiſtent with his former: He ought onely to protect his ſubjects in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as it does relate to the good and benefit of his ſubjects in general. I ſay therefore, notwithſtanding any ſuch ſubſequent promiſe, is not any
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:200520:125"/> King obliged to it; but may in caſe of publick neceſſity, govern by Martial Law, and deſtroy any particular Subjects eſtate, rather then enemies, or ſeditious men ſhould make advantage thereof to the endangering of the publick: Nor is this any new thing, but always was in all ſpecies of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments ſince the World began; nor does any King ſin in making ſuch promiſe, for he may juſtly do it, and thereby ſecure the mindes of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who would otherwiſe be in a continual diffidence; nor does he ſin in not performing this promiſe, when it becomes inconſiſtble with the publick good; for no King can poſſibly foreſee all the publick neceſſities and dangers which may happen.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. No mans being greater or leſſer, does free him from his duty which <note place="margin">Injuſtice in Princes.</note> he owes to the Laws of God; all men being alike, as compared to God. Kings therefore being ſo, are not diſobliged to the Laws of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: It was therefore a ſin of injuſtice in <hi>Ahab,</hi> to take the poſſeſſion of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, the property and inheritance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being given by God, and unalienable by the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I ſay this was a ſin of injuſtice in <hi>Ahab;</hi> for his being a King, did not free him from Gods Laws, but did without any publick neceſſity, abuſe the power and command which God had given him as King, to the damage and hurt of <hi>Naboth</hi> and his poſterity. <hi>Davids</hi> putting <hi>Uriah</hi> to death, and <hi>Ahabs</hi> conſenting to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi>'s death, although after his death, were ſins of injuſtice; for they were entruſted by God to be Kings for the good of their Subjects: Whereas they did abuſe and falſifie their truſt to the higheſt wrong of others, whom they ought to have protected: <hi>Princes are Gods Miniſters for their Subjects good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. Man being a reaſonable and ſociable Creature, which being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible <note place="margin">Rom 13. 4. Kings by right command next after God.</note> with community and parity, and mankinde being onely conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Society, that is in the mutual commanding and obeying of different parties: And as God by higheſt right, ought in all things to be obeyed, ſo Kings ought to be obeyed next after God in all things: For every Soul ought to be ſubject to the higher powers; for there are no powers but of God, and the powers that be, are ordained of God: And through me Kings reign, <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1. Prov. 8. 15.</note> and Princes make juſt Laws. All things therefore which Princes command (where God hath not left neceſſary Laws for the good and governing of their Subjects, which he was onely pleaſed to do to his peculiar people the <hi>Iſraelites,)</hi> are therefore juſt, becauſe they command them, they command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing repugnant to the Laws of God.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. A Prince commands a Judge to execute the known Laws uprightly; <note place="margin">Injuſtice in Subjects.</note> he becomes corrupt, and ſells, or otherwiſe purloyns judgment. I ſay this is a ſin of injuſtice in the Judge, for he abuſes the command of his Prince, who by right might command him to the damage of another, againſt whom falſe judgment is given. It is an act of injuſtice in all Subjects in general, to abuſe the truſt committed to them by their Soveraigns, for he by right may command, and entruſt them; nor can they abuſe their truſt, but it muſt be to the damage of the Prince, or ſome other. But beſides expreſs Obedience of Subjects to their Soveraigns, when they are particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by them, there is a general and implied Obedience which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ow to their Soveraigns, and the Laws of their Countrey, as Subjects; whether they be employed in any place of truſt, or not: For ſubjection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the predicament of Relation, does imply a right of command; and

Well, but before we examine it, let us take the definition of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical proportion: Harmonical proportion is, when three numbers are ſo ordained, that the difference which the Major and the Minor extream, have to the mean, is in the ſame proportion that the Major, is to the leſſer: As 3. 4. 6. are in Harmonical proportion, becauſe the difference which 6. the Major extream hath to 4. is 2. and the difference which 4. hath to 3. the leſſer is 1. Now 2. the difference of the Major extream 6. to the <hi>medium</hi> 4. being double to the difference of 4. the mean, to the leſſer extream 3. and 6. the Major being double to 3. the Minor, 3. 4. 6. are in Harmonical proportion. <hi>Bodin</hi> ſays, 4. 6. 8. 12. are in Harmonical proportion, as the <note place="margin">

But how does the Analogy of the ſecond to the third, of 6. to 8. couple the extreams of 4. and 12. or how can 4. 6. 8. 12. be in Harmonical proportion; when as the difference of 12. to 8. and 6. to 4. is but double, and the proportion of 12. to 4. triple?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, But though he hath not found Harmonical proportion here, <note place="margin">His ſecond confuted.</note> (ſure then his Harmonical Juſtice upon which it is built, will be but a very mean ſtructure) it may be he findes it ſomewhere elſe, where he ſays, 4. 6. 8. <note place="margin">

Which does not only plainly appear from very many places of Scripture, as that the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would have delivered <hi>David</hi> if he <note place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 12.</note> had not eſcaped thence; that God would have deſtroyed <hi>Niniveh</hi> within forty daies, if the men had not repented; that God would have gathered the children of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> together as a Hen gathereth her Chickens, but <note place="margin">Matth. 23. 27.</note> they would not; that if the mighty works had been done in <hi>Tire</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> which were done in <hi>Chorazin,</hi> they had repented in duſt and aſhes, &amp;c. <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 21.</note> but alſo all Gods promiſes and curſings upon men do depend upon their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or diſobedience to what he commands.

It is true indeed that God hath made man in fleſh and blood, and ſo prone to deſire many things which he ought not: But though diverſe men do naturally affect and deſire things they ought not; yet God hath ſo made every man a free Lord of all his actions, that there is no man but may chuſe whether he will do, or not any thing to the attaining of his appetitions and affections. And mans excellency above other creatures conſiſts in this, that his actions are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by his objects, as other creatures are; but he may freely do this action, as it is moved in him from the appetition of pleaſure, profit, pride, &amp;c. or abſtain from it as he apprehends it forbidden by him who may forbid: And ſo may any man freely do or endeavor to do any thing which he ought to do, though to his temporal diſadvantage, (but this having no Temporal motive, muſt proceed from Gods grace) which no creature upon earth can do but only man; only man therefore can do virtuous actions.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. EQuity is twofold, either a remiſſion or moderation of the Laws <note place="margin">How mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold is Equity.</note> when the execution of Laws will rather kill then cure a diſtemper in the Subject; as when many Subjects either upon paſſion, or being ſeduced, have ſo far tranſgreſſed Laws, that they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by Law their lives and eſtates; yet in ſuch caſe are not ſupream powers rigidly to exact all which the Law gives them, but it is equity ſo to puniſh the principal Authors, and other Subjects, that others may be deterred from the like, and the generality offending, preſerved. So where the Law commands upon penalty, and it becomes impoſſible for the Subject to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, (as it ever was, and will be) there it is equity to remit the penalty. Where therefore the Law obliges a Tenant to pay his Landlord ſuch a Rent, yet if by inundation of waters, ſterility of the ſeaſon, &amp;c. it comes to paſs that the Tenant by no fault of his, either cannot, or it will be the ruine of himſelf and family, to pay it, there it is equity in the Landlord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or moderate what by Law he might juſtly exact.</p>
                        <p>Or ſecondly, a ſupplement of the Law in caſes wherein things in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ought to be done, yet for want of ſome formalities, or niceties they cannot in ſtrictneſs of Law be exacted.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Equity is, when with a ſincere intention, men (although it be to <note place="margin">How Equity differs from Judgment.</note> their prejudice) endeavor to pleaſe God. Judgment, a giving ſentence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Laws.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In Courts of Judicature, the Judges proceed according to the declared <note place="margin">The neceſſity of Courts of Equity.</note> Laws, and ought not in judgment to vary or ſwerve from them, but proceed as they are impowred by Law and their Commiſſion; and Laws are made uſually <hi>ad terrorem,</hi> rather to affright men, then to puniſh all offenders; which Laws were they not moderated, it were impoſſible for all men to ſubſiſt under the burden of them; nor is there any man but has need of Gods mercy, and the Kings. Courts of Equity therefore are as neceſſary, as Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</p>

                     <p>HAving before treated of the Cauſes of all Regal and Eccleſiaſtical power; and having in the laſt Chapter of the Third Book treated of the Laws and Civil Government of this Nation, being the exerciſe of Regal power in reference to the publick preſervation of Peace and Society in it: In this Firſt Chap. we ſhall treat how far Eccleſiaſtical power has been exerciſed in this Nation, and by whom; Whether originally the <hi>Britanick</hi> and <hi>Engliſh-Saxon</hi> Churches were free, or ſubject to the Papal power, <hi>quoad exercitium?</hi> And whether as well before the Conqueſt, as after, the Kings of this Nation were not Nurſing Fathers to the Church of Chriſt? And whether always before the Conqueſt, the Royal Government did not extend as well to the Perſons, as Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions of Eccleſiaſtical perſons? And whether all Biſhopricks were not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of the Kings foundation?</p>
                     <p>In the reciting the Eccleſiaſtical Laws made by the Kings and Queens of this Realm, we ſhall obſerve three periods, <hi>viz.</hi> The Eccleſiaſtical Laws made by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> before the Conquest; The Laws made by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror and ſubſequent Kings, until <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; And laſtly, the Laws made by him, and the Kings and Queens after him, until the end of King <hi>Charls</hi> his Reign.</p>
                     <p>Note <hi>(good Reader)</hi> that in the reciting of theſe Laws, I do not affirm that theſe Laws made by the Kings of this Realm, did never incroach upon that Ghoſtly power which our Saviour by Divine poſitive inſtitution left only to his Church; and therefore make no conſtruction upon them, but only when they are recited and objected as Authorities against that Power. My deſigne is to ſhew, (having already demonſtrated, that by the Law of Nature, the perſons of all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects born in the dominion of rightful Kings, are their natural Subjects; which is an indelible character, and can never be waſhed out; and therefore Subjects being Eccleſiaſtical perſons, cannot free them from it: And that all priviledges and endowments which Eccleſiaſtical perſons enjoy beſides their ghoſtly power, is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the King:) That the exerciſe of the Kings power over the perſons and poſſeſsions of Eccleſiasticks, as alſo Laws made by them for the order and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the extern peace of the Church, is no new thing, as hath been by ſome objected.</p>

And though Education and Learning does not totally alter mens natures from bad to good; yet does it ſoften mens manners, and makes them not to be ſo bruitiſh as thoſe who are deſtitute of Learning and Civil breeding: For,</p>

                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:200520:133"/>
                        <p> It is true indeed, that in that ſtate in which God hath placed all men here, they do not ſee all things truly; but men are, and always were, and will be ſubject to humane error and frailty; and in many things (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the arts and helps which can be deviſed) men will never be reconciled. But that men ſhould therefore condemn all Science and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is like to a man that, if he ſees and hears not all things diſtinctly and clearly, (although it may be he ſees and hears well enough to do things which are neceſſary for his conſervation) that therefore he will put out his eyes, and have his ears always ſtopped. Nor ſhall ever ignorance of any mans duty, totally excuſe him for his not obſervance of Laws, be they Divine or Humane: Nor ſhall the blind belief of Subjects in their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal, ever totally excuſe them from thoſe things which are due, and they believe that they owe to God. I am not ſo very a <hi>Hobbian,</hi> as to believe that it is impoſſible for Supreme powers to command any thing contrary to the Law of Nature; nor yet ſo very a <hi>Papalian,</hi> as to think that the Pope is infallible: Eſpecially ſince it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>Aarons</hi> joining with the people in their idolatry, did not excuſe <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old; nor did the command of both King and Prieſts ever under the Old Law excuſe the ſubject <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from Gods judgments upon them for their idolatry. Nor is this very opinion of them in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Popes infallibility, believed by themſelves, however urged againſt others who are not of her communion: For then were not only General Councils ſupervacaneous and uſeleſs things, but alſo there could be no difference among them which is ſuperior, a Pope, or General Council. Nor do they leſs deny it in their practice, then their opinion: For when <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> had excommunicated (9 <hi>Sept.</hi> 1585.) the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and as he affirmed, made them uncapable of ſucceſſion to the French Monarchy; yet were moſt part of the French troubled at it, doubting the Priviledges of the Gallic Church would be trodden under foot, (which they needed not have doubted or feared, if they had believed the Pope to have been infallible;) and all the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> (who were all of the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> deſired the King, <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, to have the Bull torne in pieces, as you may read, <hi>Davila</hi> 575. And the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of <hi>Chalons</hi> and <hi>Tours</hi> did not only decree the Bull of <hi>Gregory</hi> 14. to the Prelates and Catholiques of the Kings party, (under pain of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, of being deprived of their Dignities and Benefices, and of being uſed as Hereticks and Sectaries, that within a certain time they ſhould withdraw themſelves from thoſe places that yielded obedience to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and from the union and fellowſhip of his Faction) to be publikely burnt; but it was ſo far rejected and ſcorned by the very Prelates and all other Catholiques of the Kings party, that it did extreamly confirm them all in the Kings obedience, being before unſetled and inclining to the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbons</hi> faction; as you may read more at large in the Twelfth book of <hi>Davila's</hi> Hiſtory.</p>
                        <p>But it may be they will ſay, That this was not in matter of Faith, and that the Popes infallibility is affixed to Faith. Yet this can be no objection by thoſe men, who aſcribe all infallibility to the Pope, and that all his Acts and Decrees are to be received and obeyed, by an implicite faith, as Divine oracles. Well, but ſuppoſe theſe determinations of the Pope were not concerning matters of Faith, (as no doubt they were not) then how comes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:200520:133"/> the Pope, becauſe he is infallible in the Faith, that he takes upon him to be Judge and Determiner of thoſe things, which no ways appertain to it, but are as much where Chriſtianity is not planted, as where it is.</p>
                        <p>
                           <label>Object.</label> Yet it will be objected, <hi>That if the Church be not Judge of what conduceth to the peace and ſafety of the Kingdom and Church, then who ſhall? and ſo fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to all Government, and peace in Church or State.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But before I anſwer this <hi>Quaere,</hi> I would be reſolved one Queſtion, or two: Who ſhall be Judge whether the Pope, or a General Council be ſuperior? Who ſhall judge whether in any Determination of the Popes, it be concerning matter of Faith or not? or whether it be determined <hi>in Gathedra</hi> or not? In the many Schiſmes of the Papacy, who ſhould judg who was the true Pope? or who ſhall judg whether <hi>Alexander</hi> the tenth be now the true Pope? or who ever gave the Cardinals (who were an humane inſtitution many hundred years after our Saviour) this power of Election of the Pope, that whoſoever they ſhould ſo elect ſhould be univerſal Biſhop, and St. <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor?</p>
                        <p>Although I might juſtly inſiſt hereupon, nor can theſe things upon theſe mens principles, who maintain the Popes infallibility, (at leaſt in my underſtanding) be ſolved; and ſo are they, for all their boaſt of unity among themſelves in as much confuſion and diſſention even in their very princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as other men; yet am not I aſhamed to give an account of my obedience both to my Church and King.</p>
                        <p>
                           <label>Anſwer.</label> I ſay, that God hath made man a ſociable, intellectual, and reaſonable creature, and endewed him with an immortal ſoule potentially capable of eternal happineſs. Nor will God be ſerved by man, having ſo made him, only by a baſe ſervile feare, and without the intellectual and rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſoule, and therefore has engraven by nature in the heart of every man, certain rules by which he is to direct his actions, which are the firſt principles and foundations upon which I honor my Parents, King, and them who are ſet over me for my direction, in order to my eternal good. And although that out of the Church, and not being preſerved by humane Laws, I can neither hope for ſafety in this world, nor ſalvation in the world to come; yet who he is, from whom all humane Laws are derived, or what is the Church in which I muſt hope for ſalvation, there is no viſible Judge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, but only mens conſciences to direct them, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections which God either by nature has given to men, or revealed ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally in the Scriptures. Nor does a mans conſcience thus informed, leave him after it be informed who it is from whom he ought to expect protection, and to whom he owes his obedience, as well ſpirituall as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral; for though there be no viſible means for men to hope for peace in Church or State, yet does it not follow, that by all men, all things which may be commanded for the Laws of the Church and State, are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as the Laws of Church and State; as if the Church command men to worſhip Images, or any creature for the Creator (which under the old Law it many times did, nor do I underſtand how it can be excuſed in the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> or if men be commanded by higher powers, immoral things, as to diſhonor them, or their Parents; or whenas temporal powers command things plainly derogatory to the ghoſtly power of the Church; or the Church commands things contrary to the duty men owe to their King and Country, which we daily ſee both the one, and the other do, which makes ſome men in their paſſion ultimately reſolve their Temporal
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:200520:134"/> and Eccleſiaſtical obedience into the Church; others into the ſecular power: and many deny all obedience to either, and ſet up themſelves, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in ſtead of either. But though mens affections carrie them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral waies, yet ought not all reaſon therefore and conſcience to forſake all men; for although I ought not to judge either King, or Church, if they command any thing they ought not, yet have I and every man elſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to direct them whether I ought to do all things whatſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by King or Church. Nor ought men to be frighted out of their conſciences, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law of God by nature informing them, or his Law ſupernaturally revealed, by his grace directing them, becauſe a perverſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Schiſmatical and ſeditious men, have abuſed all Temporal and Eccleſiaſtical Laws and Powers, by pretending conſcience. Nor will a blind obedience in all things to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cauſe unity and peace among Chriſtians, although it be ſo much magnified by them: for let any man read the lives of <hi>H.</hi> 4. 5. 6. and 7. and <hi>Frederick</hi> 1. and 2. Emperors, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the whole Empire was of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, and ſee if ever greater broyles were in the Chriſtian World, and let them judge whether Obedience to the Popes by ſo great a part of the Empire, were not the cauſe of them? or whether all the Wars in Chriſtendom cauſed by <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, and <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, were not againſt Chriſtians in the communion and form of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But where ſecular or eccleſiaſtical Laws do plainly command things, not plainly derogatory to Gods Law, (for where they do, God is in all things to be obeyed before man) ſo as it is doubtful whether they do repugne Gods Law or not, then certainly the beſt way is to ſubmit to them; for a mans conſcience wrong informed does not excuſe him from any Article of his duty; and if it may be the Laws do repugne Gods Law, it may be they do not; and in controverted and doubtful caſes, the Law is alwaies preſumed to be on the Governors part. Nor ſhall any mans conſcience ever excuſe him, if the Laws either of Church or Country do command things repugnant to Gods word, from the duty and obedience he owes to them in all things, where they do not repugne it. Nor does it free any man from his ſubjection to higher power, but where he cannot ſubmit, he ought to ſuffer. And no queſtion that where two evils unavoidable happen, the leaſt is to be taken; as if a man in the communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> be reduced to that neceſſity of ſimply conforming himſelf to all things uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> although his conſcience cannot digeſt many things, or be excluded out of the viſible Church of Chriſt, he had better be of ſuch a Church, then of none at all.</p>
                        <p>Sure God never affixt ſuch infallibility to men how great or good ſoever, that ſimple and blind obedience ſhould be alwaies given to their Laws; as if there were neither Laws of God, or any to whom they were given, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual or reaſonable creatures. And though no man ought to cenſure, much leſs to reproach the actions of his ſuperior, yet are no mens actions ſo cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, as great mens, and ſo much the more by how much the greater they are: for,</p>

                                       <p>GOD did ſpeak theſe words to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thus ſaid: I am the Lord thy God, I led thee out of Egypt land, and of the houſe of bondage; Thou ſhalt not chooſe other Gods before me.</p>
                                       <p>Do not take my Name in idleneſs; for I will not hold him innocent, who on idleneſs taketh my Name. Remember thou keep holy the Seventh day; Do thy work on ſix days, and on the Seventh reſt, thou and thy ſon and thy daughter, thy ſervant and handmaid, and thy work-cattel, and the ſtranger that is within thy door: For on ſix days Chriſt made heaven and earth, ſea and all things thereon were created by him, and reſted on the Seventh day, and therefore the Lord hallowed it. Honor thy Father and thy Mother, whom the Lord gave thee, that thou maiſt live long on earth. Thou ſhalt not kill. Thou ſhalt not ſteal. Thou ſhalt not commit adultery. Nor report falſe witneſs of thy neighbor; nor covet thou thy neighbors inheritance without right: Nor work golden gods, or ſilver. Thou ſhalt conſtitute theſe Judgments.</p>
                                       <p>If a man buy a Chriſtian man, he ſhall ſerve ſix years, the ſeventh let him be free without coſt: With the ſame veſtment he came in, with the ſame let him go out; if he have a wife, let her go out with him; if his Lord gave him his wife, ſhe and her <note n="*" place="margin">Children.</note> bearns are the Lords. But if the ſervant
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:200520:140"/> ſhall ſay, I will not part from my Lord, nor from my wife, nor from my children, nor from my work; then let his Lord bring him to the door of the Temple, and there let him bore his ear with an eal, for a ſign that ever after he is his ſervant. If any man ſell his daughter for an handmaid, he ſhall not uſe her as an handmaid, he ſhall uſe her courteouſly, neither ſhall he ſell her to other folk; and if ſhe be negligent, let him be pacified, let him ſet her free to ſtranger folk; if he ally her to his ſon in marriage, let him give a garment, the reward of her modeſty, and endow her; but if he will do none of theſe, let him ſet her free without price.</p>
                                       <p>If a man ſlea another willingly, he ſhall be ſlain himſelf; but if a man ſlea another not lurking or lying in wait, or unwillingly, or of neceſſity, ſo as he were given into his hand by God, let him flee to Sanctuary and ſave his life, and forfeit nothing. If a man of ambition and guile ſlea his neighbor, let him be taken from mine altar and be put to death. If a man ſlea his father or mother, he ſhall be put to death. If a man foreſtall a Freeman, and he ſell him to another man, he ſhall be put to death. If a man revile his father or mother, he ſhall be put to death. If a man ſlea another with a ſtone, or with his fiſt, and yet he can go with a ſtaff; get him a Phyſitian, and let him do his work while he is impotent. If a man willingly ſlea his <note place="margin">Note, <hi>ſlea</hi> is to ſtrike, as well as kill.</note> ſervant or his handmaid, ſo as he doth not die in a day, but live two or three nights, although he be guilty, let him be free, becauſe they were his goods; but if he die the ſame day, let him be guilty. If a man by conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hurt a wife with child, let him repair the damage that ſhall be adjudged; if ſhe die, he ſhall be put to death. If a man put out anothers eye, let him loſe his eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound with wound, skar with skar. If a man ſtrike his ſervant or handmaid ſo as he loſes an eye, let him be free therefore; or if he ſtrike out a tooth, let him be free. If an oxe gore any man or woman ſo as he die, let him be ſtoned and eat his fleſh, and let the maſter of the oxe be guiltleſs, if in two or three days he did not know that the oxe gored a man: if he knew it, and yet would keep him, and the oxe afterward kill a man or woman, let the oxe be ſtoned, and the maſter either put to death, or pay that price which ſhall be impoſed upon him for the life, be it ſon or daughter, the law is the ſame; if he be a ſervant or handmaid which is gored to death, let the oxe be ſtoned, and thirty ſhillings be paid to the maſter. If a man dig a pit and ſhall leave it uncovered, he ſhall pay the value of any beaſt that falls into it and dies. If the oxe of one gores the oxe of another ſo as he dies, let the live oxe be ſold, and his price and the fleſh of the dead one be given to the Lord; if after the oxe wound another and he die, let him ſell the oxe, and give the price and the fleſh of the oxe that is killed to the Lord thereof. If the maſter knew the oxe had gored another, and would not take warning nor ſell him, he ſhall give two, and four ſheep for one; if he hath not wherewith to pay, let him be ſold for theft.</p>
                                       <p>If a Thief break a mans houſe in the night, and there be ſlain, he ſhall not be guilty of manſlaughter; but if it be after ſunriſe, he ſhall be guilty of manſlaughter, if ready to be killed, he were not neceſſitated. If a man ſhall put fire into ſtanding corn and burn it, the author ſhall give the value of the damage. If a man truſt another with goods to keep, and he privily ſteal them, let him repay double; but if it be not found that he which was intruſted, uſed no deceit, let him be excuſed. If the thing intruſted
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:200520:140"/> were a living creature, if he can bring witneſs that it was taken away by enemies, or that it is dead, he ſhall not repay; but if he cannot bring wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor free himſelf from guilt, let him ſwear he is not guilty. If a man corrupt a virgin unbetrothed, and ſlept with her, let him be fined, and take her to wife; but if her father will not ſo beſtow her, let him pay her portion, after the value of virgins portion. Women Fortune-tellers, Charmers and Soothſayers, ſuffer not to live. He that hath had any thing to do with a beaſt, ſhall be put to death. He that offers ſacrifice to any other Gods, ſhall ſuffer death. A ſtranger or inhabitant thou ſhalt not hurt, for thou wert a ſtranger in the land of Egypt. A widow or orphan do not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs nor vex; if you ſhall oppreſs, and they complain, I will hear their prayrs, and ſlea you with my ſword, your wives ſhall be widows, children orphans. If thou lend money to thy acquaintance, be not a gainer from him, nor exact uſury of him. If thou take the garment of one for a pledg, who hath only that for a covering, reſtore it before the ſun ſet; but if he complain to me, I will hear him for my mercy. Do not ſpeak evil of the Lord, nor curſe him who is the Prince of the people. Pay thy Tithes, and thy firſt born and firſt-fruits give to God. Do not taſte the fleſh torne from beaſts, but caſt it to the dogs. Do not truſt to a deceitful mans word, nor hearken to it as to obey it; nor favor him in judgment, nor eſteem his witneſs but as a tale. Do not follow the ill counſel of the people, nor in controverſie of right incline to the opinion of the multitude; nor do thou hold any thing common with wrong. If thou ſhalt find any fourfooted beaſt of thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſtraying out of the way, reclaim him. Judge rightly; do not judge otherwiſe to the poor and adverſary, then to the rich and friend. Do not tell a Lye. Do not ſlea the innocent and juſt. Do not take a gift, for it oftentimes blinds the eyes of the wiſe, and perverts the ſpeech of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Do no injury to the ſtranger nor inhabitant. Do not take the names of other Gods in ſwearing, nor have them in thy mouth.</p>
                                       <p>Theſe are thoſe Laws which the Almighty God himſelf did give to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and commanded him to keep; and alſo the onely begotten Son of God, when he came into the World, openly taught, That he did not come down to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it with gentleneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for he delivered the rule of true Piety. After that, they nailed him to the Croſs, before that his Apoſtles (were together, nor were ſcattered for preaching the Goſpel) converted many Nations; and ſent Apoſtles and Interpreters of the Scripture to <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> to learn Chriſts Law; and what ſhould then befal them, ſhould by a Meſſenger be ſent back to them in writing. This is that Epiſtle which the Apoſtles ſent to all the people of <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which were converted from the bondage of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to Chriſt.</p>
                                       <p>The Apoſtles and Elder Brethren, wiſh health to you. Aſſoon as we heard that certain men, which went from us, had troubled you with words, and commanded ſome things which they had not in command from us, and had made your ſouls ſad, rather then inſtructed you with ſound and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Doctrine; it ſeemed good to us, being met together, to ſend to you <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who had ventured their life for the Name of Chriſt: With them we ſend <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> who ſhall ſpeak the ſame words. It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and us, not to impoſe more neceſſary burden, then theſe things upon you; That ye abſtain from things offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:200520:141"/> to Idols, and Blood, and things ſtrangled, and from fornication; and that ye will that which ye would other men ſhould do to you. From this one Commandment it is manifeſt, That a man ſhould reſtore every man his right, neither is there need of any other Law-book. This he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, who ſits a Judge over other men, That he ſhould not give that judgment upon other men, which he would not have given upon himſelf. After the Goſpel of Chriſt was preached, many Nations, as alſo the Engliſh, by Faith joyned themſelves to the Word of God: Some Biſhops and other famous men, as well in <hi>England,</hi> as other Regions, held a Council of wiſe men; and theſe men, taught by Gods mercy, impoſed upon every ſinner a pecuniary mulct, and left the power of exacting it to the Magiſtrates, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any offence to God, having obtained leave; onely to the betrayer and forſaker of our Lord, they did not judge fit that this light puniſhment ſhould be inflicted, becauſe they deemed ſuch a man not worthy to be ſpared, as well, becauſe God would have ſuch contemners of him unworthy of all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as alſo, that Chriſt, Gods Son, would not have mercy on them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him to death; and he bid them to worſhip God before any other. They therefore, in many Synods, conſtituted puniſhments for all ſins, and commanded them to be written.</p>
                                       <p>Theſe Laws have I <hi>Alfred</hi> the King gathered together, and commanded to be written, a good part whereof our Anceſtors have religiouſly obſerved; there are alſo many things worthy to be obſerved of us with like Religion in this age; yet ſome there are which ſeem leſs profitable to us, by the advice of wiſe men I have altered, ſome I have made new: And becauſe it may ſeem raſhneſs for any one to command to be written more then his own Decrees; as alſo it would be an uncertain thing how they would be eſteemed afterward, of which we make great account: Whatſoever are worthy to be obſerved in the acts of <hi>Inas</hi> my Kinſman, of <hi>Offa</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> or <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> who was the firſt of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> that was baptized, I have collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all, and the other left: And in taking them, I <hi>Alfred</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> have uſed the counſel of the moſt wiſe men, and it hath pleaſed them all to judge them worthy to be kept.</p>

                                       <p>O Lord, I beg that thy mercy may prevent this thy ſervant, that all his iniquities may ſuddenly be blotted out by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                                       <p>Hear, I beſeech thee, O Lord, the prayers of the humble crying unto thee, I beſeech thee O Lord.</p>

However the matter be, let not the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian prejudge the Sinner, nor thruſt him into deſperation. When any one will confeſs his ſins, firſt he ſhall hear him courteouſly what this his intention ſhould be, and whether he would or could humbly confeſs thoſe things he had committed, and ſearch out all his guilt.</p>
                                       <p n="3">3. Ask him of his manners, and extort his guilt, and lay before him all thoſe things he has done. But this keep always ſecret, that you may never in the ſame manner judge rich and poor, freemen and ſervants, thoſe elder and thoſe younger, the healthful and unhealthful, the humble and proud, the ſtrong and weak, them in Gods ſervice, and the ſecular.</p>
                                       <p>A prudent Judge ſhall wiſely diſtinguiſh concerning the fact, <hi>viz.</hi> What, how, where, and when it was committed: And though in no place or time ſin is lawful, yet upon Feſtival and Faſting-days, and Feſtival places, every one ought more carefully to obſtain from this. And by how much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or of more dignity any one is, ſo much more grievouſly is every one to be corrected before God and man for his ſins: For to the ſtrong and feeble, a like burden is not to be impoſed, nor upon one infirm as one health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but men muſt diſtinguiſh between them with a prudent moderation.</p>

                                       <p n="9">9. I ask and beſeech my Lord for remiſſion of all theſe, that the Devil may never by his ſnares prevail againſt me, leſt at any time I ſhould die without confeſſion and amendment of my ſins, even as to day I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed all my ſins before our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, who governs heaven and earth, and before that Altar and thoſe Reliques, and before my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor and Maſs-prieſt of the Lord; and as I have given a pure and true confeſſion, and am ready to correct all my ſins, and as much as in me lies, with all carefulneſs hereafter to avoid them.</p>

                                       <p n="26">26.

                                       <p n="28">28. If a Maſs-prieſt or Monk kill a man, let him loſe the dignity of

                                       <p n="30">30. If a Maſs-prieſt or Monk be wantonly luſtful, or violate matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, let him faſt ten years, and always lament; a Deacon ſeven, a Clerk ſix, a Laick five. So be it.</p>
                                       <p n="31">31.

                                       <p n="41">41. If any one uſes witchcraft to procure love, and therefore compound any drugs or amorous potion to eat or drink, or uſe Negromancie; if he be a Laick, let him faſt upon Wedneſdaies and Fridaies half a year in bread and water, but upon other daies let him enjoy meat, that is not fleſh. A Clerk,

A Deacon three years <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> A Maſs prieſt five years, whereof one in bread and water, and on every Friday of the other in bread and water, and on the other days let him abſtain from fleſh.</p>
                                       <p n="42">42. If any man againſt nature, and againſt the good creature of God, any waies defiles himſelf, let him lament whilſt he lives what he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated.</p>
                                       <p n="43">43. If any one overlaies an infant in ſleep, whereof it dies, let him faſt three years, one of them in bread and water, and in the other two, three daies in every week. But if it ſhall happen from drunkenneſs, he ſhall be more grievouſly puniſhed as his Confeſſor ſhall teach, and the delinquent alwaies lament.</p>
                                       <p n="44">44. If an infirm infant dies a Heathen, and this came to paſs by fault of the Prieſt, let him loſe the degree of his Ordination, and diligently make compenſation. And if it hapned through the negligence of his friends, let them faſt three years, <hi>viz.</hi> one in bread and water, and the other two, three daies in a week, and alwaies bewail it.</p>

                                       <p n="46">46.

                                    </div>
                                    <div type="section">
                                       <head>Of Satisfaction.</head>
                                       <p n="1">1. In this kind of confeſſion, the help of ſome Divine does very much conduce to the expiation of ſin, not leſs then the counſel of ſome learned Phyſitian to the curing of a diſeaſe.</p>
                                       <p n="2">2. Oftentimes men ſin by concupiſcence, and ſometimes through the inſtigation of the Devil; and that is moſt terrible, that men bound to God, ſo often againſt God, as they loſe their dignity.</p>
                                       <p n="3">3. And to amend this, there is need of ſevere penance, but alwaies according to the manner of the order and ſin, as is ordained in the Canons; and every one ought with all his ſtrength and endeavour, and alſo with trouble from the bottom of his heart to go about this. Some may undergo the penance of one year, ſome of more, but alwaies after the manner of the ſin; ſome of one moneth, others of more; ſome of one week, others of more weeks; and ſome of one day, others of more; and ſome all the daies of their life.</p>
                                       <p n="4">4. It behoves a Phyſitian, who will heal grievous wounds, to make uſe of exquiſite medicines: But there are none ſo grievous wounds as theſe ſins,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:200520:149"/> for theſe wounds lead men to eternal death, unleſs by confeſſion, repentance or ſatisfaction they make themſelves whole.</p>
                                       <p n="5">5. Therefore, both man and woman may be Phyſitians who ſhould heal theſe wounds: Firſt the wound is to be inquired into by good counſel; then the ulcerated matter, which does inwardly putrifie, is to be let out, that is, he purge himſelf through confeſſion.</p>
                                       <p n="6">6. Every man who will blot out his ſins by confeſſion, embraces found doctrine, not leſs then he, who takes a healthful potion from the Phyſitian, a deadly diſeaſe.</p>
                                       <p n="7">7. No Phyſitian can rightly cure any diſeaſe or wound, until the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous matter which putrifies inwardly, be drawn out: Neither can any man rightly teach penance, who refuſes to confeſs; nor can without confeſſion of ſins, pronounce abſolution; like as he cannot well be made ſound, who hath drunk any deadly thing, unleſs the venemous force be expelled.</p>
                                       <p n="8">8. Confeſſion being finiſhed, any man may by penance eaſily obtain Gods mercy, if he does this from the bottom of his heart, and moreover deplore that he ſeduced by the Devil committed theſe ſins.</p>
                                       <p n="9">9. A prudent amendment does very much benefit this confeſſion, as the cure of a ſickneſs a good Phyſitian. Concerning the works of any one, the Confeſſor may enquire by the Canons, and moderate according to the power and wealth of them confeſſing, as he believs the contrition and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of any ones heart.</p>
                                       <p n="10">10. That is great penance, when a Laick muſt lay down his arms, and make pilgrimage far and neer barefoot; who muſt not lie two nights in one place, who faſts much and watches, who daies and nights prays earneſtly, and who willingly wearies himſelf, and who is ſo untrimmed, that no iron hath touched his hair or nails.</p>
                                       <p n="11">11. Who neither comes into warm bath, nor ſoft bed, nor taſtes fleſh, nor drink which may make him drunk; who comes not into a Church, but yet zealouſly ſeeks holy places, and confeſſes his ſins, and asks interceſſion; who kiſſes no body, yet bitterly deplores his ſins.</p>
                                       <p n="12">12. He is propitious to himſelf, who in this manner prejudgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And indeed this man is happy, although in nothing he is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchful, then that he might fully correct himſelf. Neither was there ever in the world any ſo grievous a ſinner, but he might appeaſe God, if he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently went this way.</p>
                                       <p n="13">13. There are many waies to appeaſe God for ſins; and alms do very much conduce to the forgiveneſs of them.</p>
                                       <p n="14">14. He who hath means ſufficient, let him build a Church to the praiſe of God; and if he hath more beſides, let him give land to it, and bring in young men, who may perform holy ſervice for him, and therefore daily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to God; and let him repair Gods Church for his means, and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies; let him make Bridges over unpaſſable waters, and dirty places; let him diſtribute for Gods ſake that which he has, and with as much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as he can; let him carefully relieve the poor, widows, orphans and ſtrangers; let him manumiſs his own ſervant, let him redeem ſervants from other men to be ſet free, eſpecially the poor man taken in war; let him feed and clothe men in want, and allow them houſeroom and firing, and bath and bedding; and in his neceſſity in all places let him make interceſſion in ſinging Maſſes and Pſalms; and let him in his devotion towards his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:200520:149"/> Lord God very much chaſtiſe himſelf, by abſtaining from meat and drink, and all other bodily deſires.</p>
                                       <p n="15">15. And he who hath leſs means, let him ſet himſelf all he can, that in his devotion towards God he paies tithes of all he poſſeſſeth; that he examine himſelf as often as he can, and often with alms viſit Churches, and ſalute Holy places with lights, and give his houſe meat, and protection to them that need, and alſo fire and ſome nouriſhment, and bed and bath, and take care to clothe and feed the poor as much as he can.</p>
                                       <p n="16">16. For Gods love let him viſit the ſorrowful and ſick, and bury the dead, often in ſecret lie proſtrate upon his knees, and often lie proſtrate and ſtretched out upon the ground; let him faſt, watch and pray, night and day diligently. He who hath not means ſufficient to perform all theſe things, let him endeavour to do as much as he is able: Let him wear out his body againſt luſt, if ever by delicacie or luſt he hath pleaſed the devil: Now let him by faſting correct that ſin, which before he had committed by gluttony; and let him often watch and labor, if at any time he were wonted to the contrary, and given to eaſe, when he ought not, or had at other times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure watched in vain: Let him afflict himſelf with cold, and frozen baths, for that heat whereof he ſinned by luſt. If he hath any where offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another unjuſtly, let him diligently make amends; and if another hath offended him, let him be appeaſed as much as in him lies, againſt thoſe ſins which grew up in himſelf from the ſeed of the Devil: And if he hath miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any one out of the way, that he might make any gain thereof, let him carefully reduce him to the right way. This is that which I will. If he ſhall have provoked any one to ſin, let him do to him what is neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> Let him reclaim him from his ſins, and again lead him in the right way. He who diligently dehorts another from his ſins, renders his own the lighter.</p>
                                       <p n="17">17. This judgment every one by the councel of his Confeſſor may give himſelf, who with a conſtant mind will break off his ſins and correct them, <hi>viz.</hi> Let him diſtribute for Gods love all he hath; let him leave with them, lands, country, and all the deſirable things of this world, and ſerve the Lord day and night, and endeavor by all the power he can againſt his worldly deſires all the daies of his life. What then is left? that by exhorting others, he gathers to him for the ſtudy of godlineſs, by all poſſible means he can.</p>
                                       <p>Here in theſe following, ſhall be ſaid how any Sick man may redeem his declared Faſt.</p>
                                       <p n="18">18. Every man may redeem the faſt of one day with one penny; and any one may redeem the faſt of one day with two hundred and twenty Pſalms; and any one may redeem the faſt of twelve moneths, with 30<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. or by ſetting free any one of that price: And for one daies faſt let him ſing ſix times <hi>Beati,</hi> and alſo ſix times <hi>Pater noſter;</hi> and for the faſt of one day, let that man bend his knee, and bow himſelf to the ground ſixty times, ſaying <hi>Pater noſter.</hi> And alſo a man may abſolve the faſt of one day, if in his prayers to God he through all his members lift up himſelf to God by true confeſſion and right faith, and fifteen times ſing <hi>Miſerere mei Deus,</hi> and alſo <hi>Pater noſter</hi> fifteen times; Then is a lightening of the ſins of the whole day granted to him.</p>
                                       <p n="19">19. Any man may abſolve a ſeven Winters faſt in one year, if he daily
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:200520:150"/> ſhall ſing the Pſalms of the Pſalter, and do the ſame at night, and fifty on the evening; one Maſs may abſolve the faſt of twelve daies, and with ten Maſſes the faſt of four moneths may be bought off, and with thirty Maſſes the faſt of a whole year may be bought off, if any man will out of true love to God intercede for himſelf, and confeſs his ſins to his Confeſſor, and amend thoſe things as he is bidden, and alwaies afterward avoid them.</p>
                                    </div>

                                       <p n="1">1. Thus a mighty man, and having many friends, may by the help of his friends mitigate his penance. Firſt, in the name of God, and by the teſtimony of his Confeſſor, let him manifeſt a right faith, and forgive all who may have ſinned againſt him, and make his confeſſion without any omiſſion of his ſins, and endeavour to repent, and take his penance with much grief.</p>
                                       <p n="2">2. Then let him lay down his Arms, and unprofitable things, and <gap reason="foreign">

                                       <p n="3">3. When any one faſts, let him diſtribute the diſhes wherein his meat was, to all the poor men of God; and in the three daies of his Faſt, let him lay aſide all worldly buſineſs, and day and night as often as he can go to Church, and diligently watch there in Alms light, and cry to God, and beg remiſſion of ſins with a ſorrowful ſpirit and bended knees. Alſo let him often ſtretch himſelf upon the ſign of the Croſs, now ſtanding upright, now proſtrate upon the ground; and let every mighty man learn ſincerely to weep and deplore his ſins; and alſo on thoſe three daies feed as many poor men as he can; upon the fourth, let him ſtoop down to waſh their feet; and let there upon the ſame day be celebrated for the Penitent ſo many Maſſes, as any one can by any means perform, and on the time of the Maſſes let him be abſolved; and then let him take the Euchariſt, unleſs that through too much guilt he be ſo hindred, that he dares not take it: Yet let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for the future, as much as in him lies, alwaies to do well, and whilſt he lives, by Gods help, to avoid injuſtice, ſo as he may alwaies and rightly hold his Chriſtendom, and renounce Heatheniſm.

                                       <p n="4">4. This is the lightening of the penance of Great men, who abound in many friends: But it is not granted to an Indigent man to proceed ſo: It is therefore expedient more ſtrongly to exact this of him; and that as is meet that every one ſhould waſh away his ſins, and undergo himſelf his correction. <hi>Scriptum est enim, Quia unuſquiſque onus ſuum portabit.</hi>

                                    <p>THis is the Decree, which <hi>Canutus</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> by the counſel of the wiſe men, to the glory of the Immortal God, the ornament of the Royal Majeſty, and the utility of the people, hath ordained at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> upon <note n="*" place="margin">Chriſtmas. day.</note> Midwintertide.</p>
                                    <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, let all men devoutly and holily worſhip only one God, and ſtrictly hold themſelves to one rule of Chriſtian religion, and obey with all faith and obſervance King <hi>Canutus.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="2">2. And protect Gods Church, and defend it, and frequent it as well for the health of our ſoul, as the commodity of others. It is meet that one peace be comprehended in all Chriſtian Churches, and alſo that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men have it in great veneration. For, Gods peace is to be wiſhed for before other things; next after that, the Kings peace is to be kept. It is therefore very meet, that the peace of the Church of God, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity delivered into the Kings hand, be alwaies kept inviolable. If any man ſhall violate either, let him be fined and ſuffer death, unleſs the King ſhall forgive it. But if any one ſhall ever hereafter break the peace of the Church of God, ſo as he kill a man within the walls of a Church, let it be inexpiable, and all men for the love of God perſecute him as an enemy, unleſs he flee from thence to ſome <hi>Aſylum,</hi> that the King may ſuffer him to enjoy his life, after he had abundantly given recompence to God and man: Which if he ſhall do, and pay to Chriſt and the King the price of his head, then let him be inlawed: And then if he go about to make compenſation, and the King ſuffer it, let him pay the whole mulct of the Church, which is in the name of the breach of the Kings peace, and purge the Church, and be ready to perform what is meet to the Kindred and Lord of him who is killed, and be very diligent to return into Gods favor.</p>
                                    <p n="3">3. And if any man break the peace of the Church, and do not kill any man, let him make compenſation according to the nature of the crime, whether he did ſtrike, or ſtole, or committed any other wickedneſs. Firſt then, let the mulct be paid according to the nature of the crime, and the excellency of the Church: For there is not one and the ſame terrene dignity of all Churches, although all are of the ſame Divine conſecration. Thoſe crimes which may be expiated, if done in a Mother-church, let them pacifie the King, that is, with five pounds in Engliſh money; and a Middle-church with an hundred and twenty ſhillings, and that is the Kings fine; and if it be a leſſer, where there is little Service, and hath a church-yard, with ſixty ſhillings; and if a Field-church without a church-yard, with thirty ſhillings.</p>
                                    <p n="4">4. All Chriſtian men ought principally to be very careful, that Gods Holineſs, and Orders, and Places conſecrated to him, be religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and to give a due reſpect to every degree: For let them underſtand that will, or can, much and more is it that the Prieſt hath to do for the benefit of the people, if he rightly conſider it; much is the Supplications, and more is the Conſecrations, by which in conſecrating Baptiſm and the Euchariſt, the Devil is beaten and driven back; and Angels do incompaſs
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:200520:151"/> holy things, and defend their deeds, and through Gods power the Prieſt does ſuſtain them, as often as he does truly ſerve Chriſt. That is it, they do all the while the Prieſt doth from his ſoul beg of Chriſt, and earneſtly requeſt of him thoſe things which are neceſſary for the life of the people: They therefore for the fear of God ought to be preferred in dignity before other men.</p>
                                    <p n="5">5. And if any man accuſe a Prieſt Regular, and he is conſcious of no ſuch crime, let him celebrate the Maſs, and take the Euchariſt thereon, if he fear not to do it, and it ſhall free him from the calumny of one man: But if there be a threefold accuſation, having taken the Euchariſt, (if he preſume to do it) and having joined himſelf to two of his Order, let him blot out all ſuſpition of the ſuppoſed crime. If any one ſhall accuſe a Deacon being a Regular, of a crime by a ſingle teſtimony, the Deacon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining himſelf with two of his Order, may free himſelf from the crime: But if there be a threefold accuſation againſt him, the Elders of that Order being aſſembled, let him free himſelf of the crime. If any accuſe a Country-Prieſt, who hath bound himſelf in no Order of Religion, let him purge himſelf as a Deacon living by rule. If any man who ſerves at the Altar be accuſed of a crime, and is ſo friendleſs that he cannot get one who will ſwear with him, let him eat the execrated bread, and let God judge of the thing; unleſs it be lawful by taking the Euchariſt to free himſelf from the crime. If any man in holy orders be accuſed of capital Broils, ſo as that he were the author or counſellor of the death of another, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by offering himſelf to the kindred of them who were ſo beguiled or ſlain; and if he hath no kindred, let him betake himſelf to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, or faſt until he be lean, and eat the execrated <note n="*" place="margin">

But let not a Monk anywhere with right accuſe another of breach of friendſhip, or pay any thing for feuds; for he hath rejected whatſoever he might acquire by the right of kindred, when he firſt bound himſelf to the rule he profeſſes. If a Maſs-prieſt be not very upright in taking of witneſs, or be forſworne, or be the author or counſellor of any theft, let him be diſpoiled of the dignity of his function, and be deprived as well of all ſociety and friendſhip, as honor, unleſs he ſhall give abundant ſatisfaction to God and man, as he ſhall be commanded by the Biſhop; yet let him give ſecurity, that afterward he ſhall not commit ſuch things. But if he will purge himſelf, let him do it by the triple purgation, or according to the nature of the crime.</p>

Certainly a reward will be given to every one of us, according to the deeds of every one: Then woe be to the miſerable, which in their life deſerved the eternal puniſhments of hell. And therefore, that we may diligently avoid our miſdeeds, let us ingenuouſly confeſs our ſins, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all wickedneſs for the future, and duly compenſate, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thoſe Laws to others, which ſhall not be grievous to obey. This is
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:200520:152"/> right Judgment, and with God acceptable; and he is truly bleſſed, which by rule ſhall judge. For, Almighty God, the Creator of all things, created us all, and with an ineſtimable price redeemed us, <hi>viz.</hi> with his own life poured out upon us.</p>

                                       <p>Now I beſeech all men, and in the name of Almighty God command every man, that they be truly from their heart converted to God, and with all care and diligence ſearch out what is to be followed, and what avoided. And truly it does much conduce to our ſouls health, that we love God, and hold his precepts and admonitions, and hear his word by his teachers: For we ſhall bring forth theſe to be ſeen in that day, wherein God ſhall come to give judgment upon all men according to thoſe things they did whilſt they lived. And then at length ſhall that bleſſed Keeper bring the Flock committed to his charge, into the Heavenly kingdom, and the joys of Angels, for thoſe things which he had done in his life; and alſo that bleſſed Flock follow that Paſtor, who hath wreathed it out of the hands of the Devil, and give the gain to God. And further we ſtudy, that all men may ſo agree to pleaſe God, that for the time to come we may avoid the flames of Hell-fire. The Interpreters of Gods Law ought often to preach the benefit of Divine things; and indeed it is their function, and does much benefit all men to ſalvation: And all men ought with a good mind diligently to hear, and have Gods admonitions always fixed in their ſoul for their profit. And laſtly, that every one, by his words and deeds all he can, holily and thankfully do well, to the greater amplitude and glory of God his Lord; for ſo at length we ſhall abundantly all of us obtain Gods mercy. Let the name of the Lord be praiſed, to whom be laud, honor and glory for ever. God Almighty be merciful to us all, according to his will. <hi>Amen.</hi>

But the Barons who have their juriſdiction of their men, let them ſee that they do ſo concerning them, as they incur not diſpleaſure with God, and offend not the King. And if a Suit does ariſe concerning men of other Baronies in their Courts, let the Juſtice of the King be preſent, becauſe without it the Suit cannot be determined. If any of the Barons hath not Juſtice in the Hundred where the Plea ſhall be holden, it ſhall be determined at the next Church where the Judgment of the King ſhall be, ſaving the Right of thoſe Barons.</p>

                           <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Laws made by</hi> William <hi>the Firſt, who began to reign in the year of Chriſt</hi> 1067.</head>
                        <p>THat Nations and Kingdoms have their origination from God, we <note place="margin">Introduction.</note> have already in its proper place aſſerted. And that theſe Kingdoms thus created by God, have periods, alterations, and converſions ſet by him, which cannot be foreſeen or prevented by man, is certainly as cleer and evident as the former; and often owned by God himſelf in Sacred Writ, as well over his own people, as others. But that therefore any man or men ſhould therefore endeavour to make alterations in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, is like to a man, who becaufe all men naturally die, thinks he may kill any man, and father the fact upon God. And if God, even over his own peculiar people, did for the ſins of the Kings and people, eſpecially the Iſraelites, ſo often convert the line of the Kings; then can it not in reaſon be expected, in this Iron and much more ſinful Age, that God ſhould every where continue a fixt and certain ſucceſſion of Kings according to the ordinary courſe of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Primogeniture: But that therefore the Pope or any other creature, may arrogate to themſelves a right or power ſuperior to the Law of Nature, is no leſs abſurd, then that a Son may kill his Father, becauſe all Fathers have periods ſet by Nature, which they cannot paſs. And that all Subjects do by birth owe a natural ſubjection to rightful Princes in whoſe dominion they were born, which relations can never be diſſolved but by God himſelf, we have in their proper places demonſtrated: Yet may the exerciſe of this power be ſuſpended, ſo long as ſuch Subjects come into the power of other Princes, whether it be by conqueſt or otherwiſe, and do owe them a temporary obedience, ſo long as they continue there; and their poſterity born in their dominions, owe ſuch Princes a natural obedience, which can never be diſſolved. And alſo that ſince there is no other Judge under Heaven to decide the controverſie of Princes, but their ſwords, (which can never be alledged by any Subjects who have Laws to decide their differences) ſuch deciſion is good, as to the exerciſe of any Princes power over all them who fall under ir, and all Subjects born in ſuch exerciſe of power or dominion, become natural Subjects to any Prince who by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt acquires the dominion of another; we have alſo demonſtrated in its proper place. Yet whether it were of old, that Popes did arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves this right of depoſing Temporal Princes, or debarring them of their right, which about this time was frequently aſſerted by, and practiſed by the Popes, and which Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> was pleaſed to confer upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, againſt all Right and Law, to the manifeſt prejudice of <hi>Eadgar Athelin)</hi> let us ſee the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Eleutherius</hi> to King <hi>Lucius,</hi> as it is cited in <hi>chap.</hi> 17. of S. <hi>Edovards</hi> Laws.</p>

If a man ſuſpect a Judge, or think himſelf oppreſſed; ſurely Judges ought not to be ſo, <hi>niſi quos impetitus Elegerit:</hi> Neither may any one be heard, or give judgement before that they be choſen, and he who refuſes to conſent to the elected, let no man communicate with him, until he obey; but if in judgement there ariſes diſſention among the parties, of which a ſtrife comes forth, let the ſentence of the more prevail. It is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in the Cauſe of Faith, or of any Eccleſtaſtical Order, he ought to judge, who neither takes reward, nor is of another Law, and will do nothing without an accuſer: For God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt did know <hi>Judas</hi> to be a Thief; but becauſe he was not accuſed, therefore he was not rejected, and whatſoever he acted among the Apoſtles, for the dignity of his Office, remained firm: As alſo Clerks ought not to receive Laiks Accuſers, ſo ought not Laicks to receive Clerks to be Accuſers of Clerks in their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations and Informations; and Witneſſes ought to be legitimate, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent without any infamy or ſuſpition, or manifeſt ſpot, becauſe they cannot rightly accuſe Prieſts, who cannot be Prieſts, nor of their Order; nor is it needful to Judge a man before he hath had lawful Accuſers preſent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts a place of defence to waſh out his crimes. And it is our pleaſure, as often as many crimes are objected to Clerks by Accuſers, and they cannot make good one of the firſt of which they are accuſed, they ſhall not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the reſt. And a Biſhop ſhall not be condemned, unleſs by ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Witneſſes, nor the Archbiſhop be judged of any.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:200520:158"/> admitted. If a man ſtricken, will, he may plead his cauſe before his Judge; and if he will not before his Judge, he may hold his peace; and as for men ſtricken, as often as they deſire reſpit, let it be granted: And every man which objects a crime, let him write that he will prove it; and if before he be changed, he will not follow, he is convinced, no crime is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But if he will proſecute, if he ſhall not prove what he objects, let him undergo the penalty which he brought; the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Againſt a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a writing is not to be received without two or three approved witneſses;</hi> how much more againſt Biſhops, if theſe things be obſerved of Presbyters, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faithful men? If any one will accuſe any of the Clerks in an accuſation of Fornication, according to the precept of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> two or three teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are required from him; but if he cannot prove what he ſaith, by the teſtimonies given, the accuſer may take the excommunication of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and let no man believe him concerning himſelf, declaring upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crime; but a confeſſion extorted by fear or fraud, is invalid. Let a Prieſt beware, that whoſoever confeſſes his ſins to him, he tell no body of them, becauſe he confeſſeth to him, not to his neighbors, or ſtrangers; which thing if he do, let it be ſet down, and repent all the days of his life ignobly in Pilgrimage. And if at any time a Biſhop ſays any man hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to him any proper crime, and he deny it, let not the Biſhop think it does not belong to his injury, that he is not believed for himſelf alone, and if for ſcruple of his conſcience, he ſays he will not communicate to him; oftentimes good men are ſilent, and ſuffer the ill things which they have known, becauſe they are forſaken in their documents, and cannot allow of their Judges; for although they are true, yet are they not believed of the the Judge, unleſs they be proved by certain appearances: But we cannot at all forbid men from the Communion, although this Prohibition be not mortal, but medicinal, unleſs men confeſs of their own accord, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by judgement: From hence it is ſuch a man is to be named, as the Apoſtle ſays, who confeſſes, or is convinced by ordinary judgement; but if by judgement it cannot be taken away, let it rather be tolerated, leſt ſome man in perverſly avoyding ill men departing from the Church, ſhould go before them to Hell: The Communion does not defile any man by partaking the Sacraments, but the confeſſion of their deeds: other mens ſins hurt not him who lives well in the Church. Of habit and clothing we read nothing commanded by God; what things are for pomp, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden: And if you ſhall ask, Canſt thou not have an humble heart in a proud dreſſing (as <hi>Heſter)</hi> God not onely in his anger, but alſo pitty, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws ſinners.</p>
                                       <p>And they are overthrown two ways: either as the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> where the men were puniſhed for their ſins; or as the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> where the very ſins of the men were puniſhed and deſtroyed; and all men are alike to beloved, but you cannot alike profit with all; theſe are rather to be adviſed with, who for the opportunity of time and places, and of other things, are more ſtrictly joyned together: To thee either is guilty, both he which hides the truth, and he which tels a lie, becauſe this will not profit, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to hurt; arrogance is not ſo to be ſhunned that truth ſhould be left. He that at any time ſhall accuſe a Prieſt before friendly admonition to his Judges, or Secular Judges, let him be excommunicated. If a Biſhop ſhall have ſtrayed from the faith, or ſecretly admoniſhed of his ſubjects, hath
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:200520:158"/> appeared incorrigible, then let him be accuſed at the Archbiſhops, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical ſeat; for his other actions he ought rather to be tolerated then corrected. If any Biſhop be accuſed for certain crimes, let him be heard of all the Biſhops in his Province, not condemned, nor judged, before he has lawful accuſers preſent, and of his Province, not aliens, and he may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Judges elected by him, unleſs there be an Appeal, which thing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them deſigned for puniſhment; but no affliction, or the keeping the thing detained, ought to injure the Appellant, or the vitiated Cauſe ayded by remedy of the Appeal: Some men have demanded a year and ſix moneths to be granted for filling up the Machinations of unskilful men, and to prepare their Reaſons, and confirm Witneſſes, and ſeek Counſel, ſome men a year, in which time moſt men agree; but leſs then ſix moneths can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found. But if Biſhops or Clerks were ejected by force or fear, or firſt diſpoyled of their goods, let all their goods be legally reſtored to them, and have ſo much time as appeared they were diſſeiſed before that they be Canonically called in to Judgement. <hi>Gregory</hi> in the Decrees. A Presbyter or Deacon, or any Clerk accuſed by the people, if the Witneſſes who ſhould prove the truth, were not certain of the crime committed, let an Oath be in the mean, and bring him for a witneſs of the purity of his innocency, to whom all things are naked and open. Alſo this thing St. <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Pope remembers he had done to one <hi>Baſſus,</hi> although made guilty by much exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he could ſufficiently evade the ſuſpicion, and avoid the emulation; <hi>Jerom</hi> upon <hi>Jeremy lib. primo,</hi> not giving this to them who would not, or of their own accord, had not made choice of making a form. An Oath ought to have companions, Truth, Juſtice, and Judgement; if thoſe things be wanting, it is not an Oath, but perjury: For if any one by compulſion be compelled to abjure that thing, which for many years he hath quietly held, the perjury ſhall not be by him ſwearing, but by him compelling: It makes not a man guilty, where the minde is not guilty. Let no man circumvent or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf. He who by a falſe ſtone ſwears, is perjured: by whatſoever art of words any one ſwears, God ſo takes, as he to whom men ſwear, does un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. But without doubt it is a leſs evil to ſwear truly by a falſe God, then to ſwear falſly by a true God; for by how much more that by which men ſwear is more holy, ſo much more puniſhale is perjury: Who exacts an Oath, it is much to the purpoſe, if he knows that to be a falſe Oath, or not knows or knows, and gives ſentence; the Laws are mine, as my faith ſtands; I dare not ſay it is no ſin, yet it is a humane temptation; if he knows him to have done it, and compels him to ſwear, it is Homicide. <hi>Siquis juret falſumte ſciente, ſi te non audierit utrum ſit procedendus, ſi proditus &amp; periculum mortis incurrat, difficillima queſtio eſt cui plus noceat, illi cui juratur an Sacerdoti. Mihi videtur quod ille cui magis prodeſt vel obeſt; veritatem ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare neceſſitate cogente non eſt peccatum.</hi> An Oath is not to be kept when bad, it is unadviſedly pronounced. The Oath of a ſon and daughter, the father not knowing it, and Vowes of a Monk, the Abbot not knowing of it, and the Oaths of a childe are void.</p>

Foraſmuch as a Church-yard that is dedicated, is the ſoil of a Church, and whatſoever is planted belongs to the ſoil, it muſt needs follow, that thoſe Trees which be growing in the Church-yard, are to be reckoned amongſt the goods of the Church, the which Laymen have no authority to diſpoſe; but, as the holy Scripture does teſtifie, the charge of them is committed only to Prieſts to be diſpoſed of. And yet ſeeing thoſe Trees be often planted to defend the force of the wind from hurting of the Church; We do prohibit the Parſons of the Church, that they do not preſume to fell them down unadviſedly, but when the Chancel of the church does want neceſſary reparations: Neither ſhall they be converted.</p>

                                       <p>How zealous a Defender of the Pope, and See of <hi>Rome, Henry</hi> the Eight <note place="margin">K. <hi>H.</hi> 8. a zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous defender of the Pope and Papacy.</note> was in the beginning of his Reign, is evident by his book written againſt <hi>Martin Luther:</hi> For, not being born <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh's eldeſt ſon, his Father being a wondtrful frugal Prince, and obſerving good natural parts in him, bred him up in literature, and deſtinated him to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> as being the cheapeſt, and higheſt preferment he could give him. But his elder brother being dead, and after him his father; The King e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming it a great honor to imploy himſelf in ſo famous a controverſie as was then maintained by the Wits of Chriſtendom, in defence and oppoſition of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> wrote a book of the <hi>Seven Sacraments,</hi> defending alſo the Papacy, and oppugned the Doctrine of <hi>Luther.</hi> This thing was ſo grateful to the Pope, that <hi>Leo</hi> 10. honored him with the Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> But after he had been married to his brothers wife above twenty years, and inflamed with luſtful affection to <hi>Anne Bullein</hi> a Paragon and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <note place="margin">From what cauſe the King became eſtranged from the Pope.</note> of the Court, he became (he ſaid) troubled in conſcience for having married his brothers wife; and therefore deſired that the Pope would exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the caſe, and ſatisfie his ſcruple of conſcience. (It is a very remarkable thing, that this ungodly Diſpenſation of <hi>Julius</hi> 2. for <hi>H.</hi> 8. his marrying with his brothers wife, ſhould be the cauſe of the King and Kingdoms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Papacy under <hi>Clement</hi> 7.) The Pope, to ſatisfie the King, gave the Cardinals <hi>Wolſey</hi> and <hi>Campeius</hi> a power Legatine to hear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the validity, or invalidity of the marriage; but the Queen refuſing to ſubmit to their determination, appealed from them to the Pope. The Pope had now a Wolf by the ears, whom he could neither keep, nor well let go: For, in pronouncing the marriage void, he feared to incenſe <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth (being Nephew to Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> and the moſt potent Prince in Chriſtendom) and in confirming it, he feared to loſe <hi>Henry</hi> the then
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:200520:171"/> moſt beloved Son of the Church, and great Defender of the Papacy, not only in writing, but alſo in joining with and aſſiſting the French King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, for freeing him from captivity, being a priſoner under <hi>Charls.</hi> The Pope therefore deſires the advantage of time, and proceeds ſlowly towards a determination: The King as impatient in his deſires, expects a ſentence from the Pope; which not being to be had, he procures Inſtruments from the Univerſities of <hi>Cambridge, Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> together with the Opinion of Learned men, That the marriage with his Brothers wife, was contrary to the Law of God, and void. The King not expecting the Popes ſentence, <hi>anno</hi> 1533. marries his beloved <hi>Anne,</hi> (but ſuch love is uſually too hot to hold, for about two years after he cut off her head:) yet the King did not wholly renounce the Papacy, but ſtill expecting the Popes ſentence.</p>
                                       <p>The Pope, for the reaſons aforeſaid, not deſiring to end the buſineſs, <note place="margin">The ſlow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Pope.</note> but to expect advantage from time, reduces the matter into ſeveral points or heads, which he would have particularly diſputed; and at the time of the Kings marriage with <hi>Anne,</hi> was not got further then the article of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,</hi> in which the Pope gave ſentence againſt the King, that it was not lawful for him to put away his wife by his own authority, without the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Judge. For which cauſe the King in the beginning of 1534. denied the Pope his obedience, commanding his Subjects not to pay any money to <hi>Rome,</hi> nor to pay the ordinary Peter-pence. This infinitely troubled the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and they daily conſulted of a remedy: Some thought to proceed againſt the King with cenſures, and to interdict all Chriſtian nations all commerce with <hi>England;</hi> But the moderate counſel pleaſed beſt, to temporiſe with him, and to mediate a compoſition by the French King. K. <hi>Francis</hi> accepted the charge, and ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to negotiate a Pacification with the Pope; where they ſtill proceeded in the cauſe gently, and with reſolution not to come to cenſures, if the Emperor did not proceed firſt, or at the ſame time with his forces. They had divided the cauſe into twenty three articles, and then they handled whether Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> had had carnal conjunction with Queen <hi>Katherine;</hi> in this they ſpent time till <hi>Midlent</hi> was paſt, when the 19. of <hi>March</hi> news came, that a Libel was publiſhed in <hi>England</hi> againſt the Pope and the whole Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and beſides, a Comedy had been made in preſence of the King and Court, to the great diſgrace and ſhame of the Pope, and every Cardinal in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. For which cauſe all being inflamed with choler, ran headlong to give ſentence; which was pronounced in the Conſiſtory the 24. of the ſame month, That the marriage between <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Katherine</hi> was good; that he was bound to take her to wife, and that in caſe he did not, he ſhould be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</p>
                                       <p>But the Pope was ſoon diſpleaſed with this precipitation: For, ſix days <note place="margin">His raſh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure repented of,</note> after, the French Kings letters came, That the King was content to accept the ſentence concerning <hi>Attentates,</hi> and to render obedience, upon condition that the Cardinals whom he miſtruſted, ſhould not meddle in the buſineſs, and that perſons not ſuſpected ſhould be ſent to <hi>Cambray</hi> to take informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <note place="margin">

                                       <p>But the King, ſo ſoon as he had ſeen it, ſaid. It was no matter; for the <note place="margin">Utterly loſes the obedience of <hi>England.</hi>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:200520:171"/> And that he would do according to the antient manner of the Eaſtern church, not leaving to be a good Chriſtian, nor ſuffering the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Hereſie, or any other to be brought into his Kingdom.</p>
                                       <p>From that time forward, <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, of a zealous Aſſertor of the <note place="margin">No anger loſt between the King &amp; Pope.</note> Papacy both by pen and purſe, became the firſt, and greateſt Oppoſer of it, of all the Weſtern Chriſtian Princes; (for the Eaſtern Chriſtian Princes, except ſometimes the Emperors of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Kings of Holy Land, did ſeldom or never ſubmit to the Papacy in her Spirituals) yet did he afterwards ſeed to be reconciled to the Pope, even by means of his Nephew <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth. Nor were the Popes much behind hand with him: For beſides <hi>Clement's</hi> petty Excommunication, <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, <hi>Anno</hi> 1538. thundred out ſuch a terrible Excommunication againſt him, as the like was never heard of; which deprived him of his kingdom, and his adherents of whatſoever they poſſeſſed, commanding his Subjects to deny him obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Strangers to have no commerce in the kingdom; and all to take arms againſt, and perſecute both him and his followers, granting them their ſtates and goods for their prey, and their perſons for ſlaves. But the Popes anger ended in words; whereas the Kings deeds took place againſt the Pope.</p>
                                       <p>But what there was in all the Kings reign, which might be called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, <note place="margin">What was the Kings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> I do not underſtand: For, whatſoever the King took from the Pope (except Peter-pence) he aſcribed to himſelf. If the Pope would be Head of the Catholique Church, the King would be Head of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> If the Pope challenged <hi>Annates</hi> and Firſt-fruits of the Biſhops and Clergy, the King would do no leſs: If the Pope did give Abbots and Priors power, being Eccleſiaſtical perſons, to make divers Impropriations to their benefit, the King will take a power to take them all away, and convert them into Lay-fees, and incorporate them ſo into particular mens eſtates, that they ſhall never return to the Church more. Nor had he any love or deſire of Reformation of the Church, but only to the Church-lands; for, all the Rites, Ceremonies, and Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was continued, and that with ſuch bloody cruelty, that a Stranger going over <hi>Smithfield</hi> one day, and ſeeing two men there executed, one for denying the Kings Headſhip of the Church, and another for ſubſcribing to the Six Articles, cryed out, <hi>Bone Deus, quomodo hic agunt vivi! hic ſuſpenduntur Papiſtae, ibi comburuntur Antipapiſtae.</hi> And ſo zealous did he continue herein, that Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, after he had fulminated ſo dreadfully againſt him, <note place="margin">

                                       <p>Although ſuch was the temper of this Prince, that he never ſpared man <note place="margin">The excluſion of the Papai juriſdiction, was an act of the King, Kingdom, and Church, of <hi>England.</hi>

                                       <p> But whatſoever the King were otherwiſe, yet ſure the Popes paſſion <note place="margin">The Pope was more unjuſt in his cenſures then the King was in exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Papal juriſdiction.</note> againſt him carried them to greater extravagancies and exorbitancies, then were on his part againſt them. For, ſuppoſe that the Pope had <hi>de facto</hi> the Inveſtitures of Biſhops, Peter-pence, Annates and Firſt-fruits paid them, and did exerciſe a juriſdiction over all the Church and Clergy; yet no queſtion, all theſe things were by the grants and permiſſion of precedent Kings; and if Kings may grant and permit theſe things, then what hinders but that they may recall them? for, <hi>Cujus eſt velle, ejus est nolle.</hi> Beſides, we have already ſhewed, that although there were not that bitter perſonal ſpite between the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and and the Popes formerly, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and <hi>Clement</hi> 7. and <hi>Paul</hi> 3. yet did many of them aſcribe as little to the Pope, as <hi>Henry</hi> did. But for a Pope to deprive a Chriſtian Prince of his kingdom, over whom he had no manner of right; his Adherents, of whatſoever they poſſeſſed; to command his Subjects to deny their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Soveraign, and Strangers not to have any commerce in the kingdom; and all to take arms againſt him and his followers, granting them their eſtates and goods for a prey, and their perſons for ſlaves, is ſo unlike to the example and precept of S. <hi>Peter</hi> (whom they pretend to ſucceed) who not only ſuffered death under Temporal power, but, inſpired by God, does command ſo expreſly obedience to Kings, not as ſubordinate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.</note> but as ſupreme: And of our Saviour himſelf, who both ſuffered himſelf under Temporal power, and paid tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and took not away, but fulfilled the Moral Law, which commands obedience to Princes and Higher powers, and whoſe kingdom was not of this world; that ſure no Turk or Infidel was ſo much an enemy to Chriſtians, or indeed rather to mankind, as to have deſired it.</p>

                                       <p>There was ſuch havock made in the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp; Ed.</hi> 6. of all Church <note place="margin">His care of the Church.</note> Lands, upon pretence (forſooth) of Reformation, that to ſtay it there was a Law made in the firſt of Queen <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 19. that all Gifts, Grants, Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Fines and other Conveyances, made by any Arch-biſhop or Biſhop of any Honours, Caſtles, Manors, Lands, Tenements, or other Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being parcell of the poſſeſſion of his Arch-biſhoprick, or Biſhoprick, or united, or appertaining or belonging to any of the ſame, to any perſon (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Queen her Heirs and Succeſſors) whereby any Eſtate ſhould or might paſs from the Arch-biſhop, or Biſhop other then for the term of 21 years, or three lives, reſerving the old Rent or more, ſhall be utterly void. <hi>Cambden Eliz. Reg. pag.</hi> 36. takes notice of the great abuſe made by the Courtiers of that clauſe, or exception of the Queen, &amp;c. And indeed <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Burley</hi> had by the Queens permiſſion ſo gelt the Biſhoprick of <hi>Ely</hi> by virtue of this clauſe, that it lay void above twenty years before any man of abilities or honeſty would take it ſo pol'd and maimed, although ſome were conunitted to priſon for refuſing of it. But King <hi>James</hi> as his firſt and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt care by an Act of Parliament in the firſt year of his Reign <hi>cap.</hi> 3. made a Law that all aſſurances afterward made to the King of any of the Lands of Arch-Biſhops or Biſhops ſhould be void; ſo that the rapine and prey made upon the Church was firſt reſtrained totally by him.</p>
                                       <p>King <hi>James</hi> was not only a devout obſervor of the Government, Rites <note place="margin">His care of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but made it one of his chiefeſt cares to have brought an Uniformity as well in <hi>Scotland</hi> as in <hi>England;</hi> and proceeded ſo far as to ſettle Epiſcopacy among them, naming thirteen new Biſhops for ſo many Epiſcopall Sees as had been anciently in that Church; three of which received conſecration from the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:200520:192"/> it on the reſt of their Brethren at their comming home: Which Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops he armed alſo with the power of an High Commiſſion, the better to keep down the inſolent and domineering ſpirit of the Presbyterians. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the other, he procured an Act to be paſſed in the Aſſembly at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdeen</hi> 1616. for compoſing a Liturgy, and extracting a new book of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons out of the ſcattered Acts of their old Aſſemblies. At the Aſſembly held at <hi>Perth anno</hi> 1618. he obtained an Order for the receiving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion kneeling, for the adminiſtring Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper in private houſes in caſes of extreme neceſſity, for Epiſcopall confirmation; and finally for the celebrating the Anniverſaries of our Saviours birth, his Paſſion, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt: all which he got confirmed in the following Parliament. So far did this wiſe King advance the work of Uniformity before his engaging in the cauſe of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> his breach with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the warre which iſſued thereupon did divert his thoughts.</p>
                                       <p>To his peacefull diſpoſition, and his care of the Church and Religion, <note place="margin">His great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</note> in the next place may be truly added his great abilities in learning, ſo far tranſcending, not only the Kings of the preſent age his contemporaries, but all his predeceſſors, and ſurely ſcarcely to be paralled by any of his time, as his many learned works teſtifie. To theſe other virtues may be added a mind no wayes vindicative, although ſometimes tranſported with preſent paſſion; yet of ſome ſmall continuance that in perſon or eſtate he was never noted to puniſh any man raſhly, or extrajudicially. And although he was no great lover of the Commons Lawes of this Land, yet a great aſſertor of them, and in diſgrace with him, would oftentimes affirm, that there was no time when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he could ſpeak reaſon, but the King would hear him. With the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theſe virtues he governed theſe Iſlands in greater peace, then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in the ordinary nature of things, could be expected.</p>
                                       <p>In the 3. year of his Reign, <hi>viz. Anno Dom.</hi> 1605. was a moſt hainous and <note place="margin">The cauſe of the many Laws made againſt Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.</note> vile attempt, intended not only againſt the very Perſon of the King, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his Poſterity, which had not advanced the deſigne of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and the Church, and all the Nobility, (not of their faction) with the Commons in Parliament aſſembled. And the conſpirators had proceeded ſo far, that they had not only made proviſion to have effected their purpoſe; and intended the fifth of <hi>November</hi> (being the day for the convention of the Parliament after their Proroguement, and therefore probably expecting not only a more then uſuall convention both of the Lords and Gentry, but even of the King himſelf) to have blown up the Parliament Houſe. But the deſigne being as fooliſh as deſperate, was diſcovered the night before it ſhould have been executed (although it is thought, that it was known even to the King himſelf, and the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> before) as by accident; and ſo had no other effect, then what the conſpirators might reaſonably have expected, had it ſucceeded, <hi>viz.</hi> ruine to themſelves (for their faction being ſo very few in proportion to the reſt of the Nation, and without either money, Forts, or Army, in reaſon they could not have done any thing conſiderable in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their further deſignes) and ſevere Lawes againſt all which might be ſuſpected to be of their faction, to prevent any ſuch further attempts.</p>
                                       <p>It is true where <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerves, that the conſpiracies of Subjects where <note place="margin">His defects and frailties.</note> they ſucceed not, doe advance the Soveraignty, and verefied in this attempt of the Gunpowder-Treaſon: for how many Lawes were that Parliament,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:200520:193"/> and afterward enacted againſt all Popiſh Recuſants, we have before ſhewed; yet ſo it happened (and ſo uſually happens, when not carefully minded by Princes) that another faction, far more formidable both to King and Church, openly pretending aſſiſtance to the King and Church in perſecuting this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſecretly acquired ſtrength to themſelves in ſo doing. Nor was this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen by this wiſe King, (being naturally a greater enemy to the Faction per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the perſecuted) but either not having that magnanimity, which is ſo requiſite in a Soveraign, or apprehending he had not means ſufficient to goe through, he neglected to apply ſuch medicines, as were neceſſary to the curing of this Gangrene ſo dilating it ſelf both in Church, Court and State; but deſiring Peace, (eſpecially at home) although almoſt upon any termes, he rather ſought to repell the breaking out of Puritaniſme during his Reign, then to eradicate it for the future. Add hereunto that being exceſſively ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Hunting; and not greatly loving the Common Lawes, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible to govern this Nation otherwiſe; and minding controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Divinity more than the management of his temporall affaires: and though free from Sacriledge and Corruption in his perſon, yet careleſſe of it in his Favourites and Countrymen: and nothing ſo prudent a Manager of the Revenues of the Crown as his Predeceſſor, whereby being forced to recede from many of his Regalities, the Reins of Government both in Church and State, became ſo looſe that (in the ordinary nature of things) it was very difficult they ſhould be reaſſumed by his Succeſſor.</p>

                                    <p>THere were ſome few Lawes made againſt Interludes, &amp;c. on the Lords day, and 10. groats penalty for offence, to be levied by Juſtices and Conſtables, which a man may read in the firſt <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.</p>

                                       <hi>(viz.</hi> for neer 80 years) in this Nation as in the beginning of his Reign; but neither doth peace make mens minds peaceable, nor were things otherwiſe well diſpoſed for the continuance of it: for not only the zealous and obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duty which the Subjects paid to the Royall name in the perſon of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was quite dead, and almoſt forgotten; the great wiſedome and learning of his Father not to be hoped for in the tender years of the Son; the Exchequer without money; and yet the King engaged in a Warre againſt the Spaniard for recovery of the <hi>Palatinate:</hi> but the Puritan Faction (which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> deſired ſo much to ſuppreſſe, and ſo much hated by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) was grown ſo farre up in Church, State and Court, that in all they were far more numerous both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all forein Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, then all his other Subjects. Nor was the condition of <hi>Ireland</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for not only the Proteſtant party were jarring among themſelves, but the Popiſh intent upon their deſtruction, which after they did execute in a terrible manner. To theſe may be added the government both in Church and State ſo neglected, that the exerciſe of any Lawes to reduce them to conformity, would be imputed to have been Innovations and Tyranny. The Kings Councell either uncapable of giving counſell, or not faithfull to their Prince. Nor was there any thing left to oppoſe all theſe growing cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, but the hopefull virtues of a young Prince (unacquainted in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:200520:193"/> affaires, and a ſtranger to all worldly calamities) which are of no more power to protect him againſt ſeditious and rebellious Subjects, then the Lawes of God, and all which may be called ſacred, will retain men in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, where they are not reſtrained by a preſent coercive power. But theſe ſtormes (which after brought this Saintlike Prince, and this wofull Church &amp; State to ſo lamentable a condition as they lately lay under) did not breake out in the very beginning of his Reign, but in all three Nations did gather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch black clouds in all his reigne, that almoſt at once breaking forth in ſuch a terrible Tempeſt, as, upon the matter, it ſo overwhelmed King, Church and Government, that there was ſcarce any footſteps of them left.</p>

                                       <p>IT is a thing very worthy of great conſideration, To thinke how the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular virtues and eminent qualities of ſo good and pious a Prince ſhould come to ſo cruell, ſo unfortunate an end; for in him was all thoſe amiable qualities, which in another age would have rendred him reverenced and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired: So ſingular Piety, <hi>That the Portracture of King</hi> CHARLES <hi>in his ſufferings,</hi> will be a Character of it beyond all expreſſion but his own; ſo ardent a zeale in Religion, that not any Regular in Religion was a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout obſerver of his Order, then the King was of the Rites and Liturgy of the Church; So free from Simony that the ſuſpicion of it in any man, (how deſerving ſoever otherwiſe) was ſufficient bar from any advancement in the Church; So juſt, that though he every day ſaw the Puritan-faction budding out more formidably, both in Church or State, yet did he never proceede illegally or in an extrajudiciall manner againſt any man, before the ſtormes of his Adverſaries broke out upon him on every ſide; So mercifull, that the Scotiſh Lord <hi>Balmerino An.</hi> 1634. being legally convict of Treaſon, was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by him; Nor was <hi>Louden</hi> proceeded againſt for holding correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the King of <hi>France,</hi> without the Kings privity, and giving him the Title of <hi>Du Roy:</hi> nor in all his Reigne (how formidable ſoever the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grew did he, before the war brake out againſt him, put any to death, except one in the <hi>Lambeth</hi> conſpiracy, for fomenting and contriving the conſpiracy againſt him: To theſe may be added a profound Judgement in the affaires both of Church &amp; State, how much it appeared in the former, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the entercourſe between him and Maſter <hi>Hinderſon;</hi> nor was his Pietie to his Parents leſſe conſpicuous, being truly the principall Mourner at his Mothers funerall, and choſe rather to expreſſe the Piety hee owed to his Father, in attending his dead body to his grave, although contrary to the cuſtome of his predeceſſors, then to inſiſt upon nicities of State; So ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:200520:194"/> was his conjugall love and chaſtity to his Queene, that a little before his death he commanded the Princeſſe <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> his daughter, to tell her Mother, that his thoughts had never ſtrayed from her, and that his love ſhould be the ſame to the laſt: Jealous he was of the honour of the Engliſh Church and Nation, and well underſtanding that where mens mindes are not well knit in Religion, nothing will long keep their affections cemented: He had a great deſire to have finiſhed King <hi>James</hi> his deſigne of uniting the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> in an Uniformity with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who had made ſome progreſſe in an Aſſembly held at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> 1616. and afterward in another at <hi>Perth</hi> 1618. which King <hi>Charles</hi> got paſſed in Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> 1633.

                                       <p>Theſe noble vertues and graces towards God, his Parents, Wife and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, were adorned with moſt eminent and ſingular perſonall vertues, and graces, as moderation in proſperity, magnanimity in adverſity; ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full patience, that after the fight of <hi>Cropredy-</hi>bridge, in his march after the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> it chanced that one of his Carriages brake in a narrow long Lane, where his Majeſty was to paſſe, and gave a ſtop to him at a time when a great ſhowre of rain happened to fall: ſome of them who were neer about him offered to hew out a way through the hedges with their ſwords, that he might get ſome ſhelter in the Villages adjoyning; but he reſolved not to forſake the Canon upon any occaſion; at which ſome ſeeming to admire his patience, his Majeſty lifting up his hat, ſaid, <hi>That as God had given him afflictions to exerciſe his patience, ſo he had given him patience to bear his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</hi> So ſevere an obſerver of his words and actions, that he was never obſerved to ſay any thing lightly or raſhly, or in his perſonall actions did any thing which might render his perſon or authority contemptible: So tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that in all his life he was never obſerved diſorderly to exceed in eating or drinking; affable, yet conſerving the dignity of his Majeſty to all men; free and open in his converſation, little practicing the only leſſon which <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh would learn his Son, <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, <hi>Qui neſcit diſsimulare neſcit regnare:</hi> So frugall, that though he had a Queen and plentifull Iſſue, and expended much more in repairing the Navy for recovering the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of the narrow ſeas, then he received of his Subjects; and the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer left empty by his Father; yet he encreaſed it before the firſt Scotiſh expedition to a greater maſs then was ever found ſince it was exhauſted by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth: So elegant and pure a ſtile he had in writing, that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to live to ſee it as much imitated by Engliſhmen, as <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s was among the Romans. Neither (which is no leſſe remarkable) were any of theſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſtained with any ſuſpected vice.</p>
                                       <p>To the qualities of his mind were joyned Ornaments of his body every way anſwerable; a venerable and gracious aſpect, yet beſt when he did not ſpeak; agility of members ſo diſpoſed, that in riding the great Horſe, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ring, vaulting, ſhooting in the Crosbow, Musket, and ſometime the great Ordinance, He was thought to be the beſt Markſman and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt manager of the great Horſe of any man in the three Nations; nor was leſſe judicious in chooſing a Winter Deere (which is one of the hardeſt taskes of a Woodman) then excellent in ſhooting a Deere.

But if he be ſo great at policy in Princes, who unjuſtly poſſeſſe anothers right, to innovate all things; then in reaſon, beſides the juſtneſs of it, there can be no greater prudence in Princes who reign by inherent birth-right, and to the wrong and prejudice of no man, to rule and govern by the old received and eſtabliſhed Lawes of the Nation; to innovate nothing (where there is no apparent neceſſity) neither in Church or State, in Lawes or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; yet who hath not ſeen the moſt Saintlike and Glorious Monarch of the Weſtern World (whoſe right was derived from innumerable anceſtors, nor was there upon the face of the earth any one that could make any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable pretence of right to his Crown) proſecuted, arraigned, condemned and executed by his own naturall Subjects, and his Queen and Poſterity ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, for no other reaſon but becauſe he did endeavour to have governed
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:200520:195"/> and protected them by the known and eſtabliſhed Lawes of the Nation? So little avails the skilfulneſs of the Pilot how good, great, or juſt ſoever, if the wind of divine favour, wherewith eternall providence governs mortall affaires, help not to bring our actions to their deſired Port,</p>

It is true indeed the Engliſh Presbyterians (who had moſt baſely accepted a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thing called the Covenant from the Kirkmen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and as injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly impoſed it upon their fellow Subjects) have not been ſo highly chaſtiſed in the generall by them, as they in <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; the Roman Catholicks in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have; yet were they ſo far from attaining their ends, that ſince all this Nation abounded with factions, that was the moſt hated and deſpiſed by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Nor were the other Factions much more reconciled and true to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to the Presbyterians; for the Army, commanded by <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> turned out the Rump of the Long Parliament which headed the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent party; and after <hi>Cromwells</hi> death the Army receives the Rump, and diſplaces his poſterity; and ſurely in this world is not to be found in any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſo many and ſo great diſtractions and diſſentions, as were in the late Protectors; nor did the Rump of the late Long Parliament maintain their long fought for and new reſtored Dominions, but were rejected by thoſe creatures that did reſtore them, with very ſmall hopes of ever attaining to it again. Yet did the Rump after reaſſume their ſupremacy (and proceeded as high and arrogantly as if they had never done wrong, but ſuffered all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and wrong by their interruption) when not only the Treaſure of this Nation was exhauſted, and all Crown, Church, and Delinquents Lands and Compoſitions converted and conſumed; but the whole traffique of the Nation interrupted and deſtroyed. And if it were ſo dangerous a thing to a Nation for one Faction to be formidable in Church or State, how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous was it where there is no viſible Church, and nothing but Factions in all the State?</p>

                                       <p>That when Lawes are ſo paſſed, it confirmes and ſtrengthens the Prince <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> both by the perſon and purſe of his Subjects, in any deſigne he ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, becauſe the repreſentatives of the Freeholders conſent unto it.

                                       <p>That Parliaments have been of that antiquity, and the Nation ſo habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to them, that it will never long be governed peaceably without them. To this I ſubſcribe.</p>

                                       <p>The frequent uſe of Parliaments takes away all ſtrangeneſſe between the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> King and his Subjects, and begets a confidence, and right underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.

                                       <p>That ſince it is neceſſary that every Prince in governing muſt neceſſarily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ultimately reſolve his confidence into ſomething beſides the Lawes, to which upon all occaſions he may betake himſelf for the Execution, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of himſelf and Subjects; and this muſt be by a conſtant Army in pay of his Subjects, according to the inſtitution of the Roman Legions: or out of a diffidence of his own Subjects, or from ſome reaſon of ſtate, truſt the protection of his Perſon, and Lawes into the hands of Foreigners, as did the Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi> before <hi>Sclymus</hi> conquered them; or as the King of <hi>France</hi> now does in the hands of <hi>Switz</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> or he muſt betake himſelf to the protection of a mercinary Army made up of his Subjects and Foreiners, as the Turks Janizaries and <hi>Spahi</hi> are: or eſtabliſh his ſecurity and refuge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the affection of his ſubjects, and intruſt them with the Militia in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as hath beene uſed heretofore in <hi>England,</hi> and that this agrees better

Strong phyſick may be proper to a man at one time, and kill him at another. Parliaments, although ordinarily are the Kings ſureſt refuge, yet by how much they are more excellent, by ſo much the worſe are they corrupted. Times are and will be bad when they are not made ſo by any cauſe in the Prince, and ſo bad that in ſuch conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture it may prove the utmoſt evill, if the Houſes, or eyther of them ſhall aſſume the title of Parliament, or give head to ſuch Factions and diſtempers. And no queſtion when the Scots invaded England in 1640, it was unſafe Councell that adviſed the King to ſummon a Parliament, and worſt of all to convene it at London, as things then ſtood. For that ſaying of <hi>Tacitus</hi> it is rather Rhetoricall, and makes againſt the Antiquity of Parliaments, then any way proves neceſſity of them upon all occaſions, unleſs he could make <hi>conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere</hi> and <hi>pugnare</hi> the ſame thing: nor could <hi>Agricola</hi> ever have obteined ſuch victory againſt our Anceſtors, if he had fought with no more then had coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled him.</p>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:200520:196"/> men; I did then conclude with my ſelf, that Religion, Juſtice and Piety cannot of themſelves procure peace and ſociety to mankind: nay what is yet more lamentable, that firſt ſublunary cauſe from whence all Subjects derive and expect their protection, is more ſubject to calamity, then the condition of the meaneſt of mortall men. Let a man take a ſurvey of all the Kings in <hi>Britain</hi> ſince there were any Records of time, and ſee whether neer one halfe of them did attain a naturall death; nor is this confined within the Seas which encompaſs our Iſle, or a new thing in other parts of the world, for,</p>

                        <p>I ſhall therefore before I conclude, endeavour to ſhew whether any peace and happineſſe may be reaſonably expected in this World, and if that may, then by what means it is to be attained; but that I might by degrees accompliſh my end, I begin with man in his firſt Cauſe and being.</p>
                        <p>Man then in his firſt being is to be conſidered, either as created or begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; as created, ſure no man in his wits will deny but that God was the prime and only efficient cauſe of his creation, who without any ordinary concurrence of naturall cauſes did ſo create him: and that this was not from a confluence of naturall cauſes, is evident; for otherwiſe it had been a Generation, not a Creation; and neceſſarily ſomething muſt be Created before any thing can be Generated of it.</p>
                        <p>Nor is God (if a man rightly conſiders it) leſſe the prime and efficient cauſe of man in his Generation then in his Creation: for it muſt needs be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to every man, That male and female are not the firſt cauſe of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, becauſe then they would alike of themſelves, without the influence of a ſuperiour cauſe be apted for Generation, and ſo every Creature of it ſelfe in a like power of Generating, one as much as another; the contrary of which every one daily ſees. Nor are all Creatures at all times alike diſpoſed to Generation, but apted and diſpoſed thereunto from ſome exterior cauſe; as we ſee in Foxes about the Brumall ſolſtice, and Ravens in January, other creatures generally about the Vernal Equinox, and Deere about the Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; which without all doubt doth proceed from the influence of the Sun, which in thoſe ſeaſons diſpoſes them thereunto: but that the Sun is not the prime and efficient cauſe of Generation is confeſſed by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> where hee faith * That in <hi>omni creature divinum quid reperiri, reſpondens Elemento ſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum,</hi>

                           <hi>eſſeque omnipotentis creatoris vicarium,</hi> It is not therefore the Sun, nor male and female, which can be the firſt cauſe of a man, or any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but that minde or Soul which governs the innumerable and vaſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Univers, and by a perpetuall motion of the Earth from Weſt to Eaſt, according to the new Hypotheſes in Aſtronomy, or of the Sun from Eaſt to Weſt, after the former Hypotheſes, through the divers Regions of the Earth, doth apt and diſpoſe all things therein to their production and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. So that God is the prime &amp; efficient cauſe, as wel in the generation, as creation of man &amp; other creatures, the manner only is different, God in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from the confluence of neceſſary &amp; contingent cauſes, doth Generate Man and other creatures, and originally did create them without any conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of cauſes. Nor is God leſſe the prime preſerver of all Creatures, then the firſt cauſe of the Creation and Generation of them: for not all the ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes of eating, drinking, ſleeping, exerciſe, phyſick, &amp;c. can
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:200520:197"/> preſerve any creature thus Generated or Created, but ſome internall cauſe, whether it be called <hi>anima?</hi> or <hi>pars animae?</hi> or <hi>quid animae?</hi> or <hi>aliquid ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens animam; aut intellectus? aut denique numen?</hi> and this is it in every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which doth worke towards its end, and orders all theſe things with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable and incomprehenſible art and providence, &amp; alwaies procures what is beſt, as well for its being, as well-being, as well for defence as ornament.</p>

                        <p>And though all theſe outward things, however neceſſary for the preſervation of every Creature, are accidentall and may be more or leſs acquired and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by every creature; yet this internall cauſe, this <hi>numen,</hi> this <hi>Lar familiare,</hi> or <hi>anima,</hi> which diſpoſes and orders all theſe outward cauſes, is not to be acquired or communicated by any Creature; So that a man muſt needs confeſſe That in all Creatures, as well as Man, there is ſome particle of divine Aire, which doth order and diſpoſe of all ſublunary meanes in a wonderfull and diverſe manner towards their preſervation, untill by a propenſe naturall diſpoſition, they all reſolve into their firſt Principles.</p>
                        <p>But theſe outward meanes are acquired and communicated, by ſeverall Creatures, divers and ſeverall waies. Some doe acquire theſe outward meanes from an innate impulſe, never with underſtanding or reaſon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them; others rarely without their underſtanding or reaſon, and this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only is Man.</p>
                        <p>Yet how fraile a mans reaſon and underſtanding is, even to the acquiring of things neceſſary for his preſervation, is evidenly ſeen almoſt in all men; for there is no man in this world who can by his underſtanding and reaſon ſo govern his actions, that thoſe things ſo directed by him, have alwaies a like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; nay often times the ſame thing propounded by the ſame man, upon the ſame grounds and reaſons hath ſo contrary an event, that at this time it ruins him, which other while was of much advantage to him. And this is daily ſeen among all ſorts of men, ſo that it is moſt manifeſt that a mans underſtanding or reaſon cannot preſerve him, as he is an intellectuall &amp; rationall Creature, nor Juſtice, Religion, and Piety as a ſociable, but ſomthing ſuperior to theſe.</p>
                        <p>What then ſhall we ſay to theſe things? Is Religion, Juſtice and Piety, and a mans underſtanding and reaſon of no account, becauſe they cannot procure peace and preſervation? Nothing leſſe; for God having firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man and other creatures without the confluence of naturall cauſes, did ever after their firſt creation ceaſe to make any other, but the ſpecies of all things have ever ſince been renewed by Generation: but in Generation God doth not renew the ſpecies of all creatures, from an abſolute act of his own, but from the coition of male and female diſpoſed thereunto, in perfect creatures: &amp; oftentimes from matter diſpoſed, many creatures are aequivocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generated, without the coition of male and female, which thing is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeene from the yeerly renuing of of frogs, caterpillars, &amp;c. The antient Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians from the obſervation of the very many creatures thus generated, in the River <hi>Nile,</hi> did believe that all perfect creatures were originally, not from creation, but from aequivocal generation. Yet though theſe ſpurious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect creatures are thus generated, yet do they all generate their like; <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Hiſt. Anim.</note> only excepts the Eele; and I could never yet ſee either Row or Milt in any of them. But though God be the prime &amp; efficient cauſe of the generation
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:200520:197"/> all creatures and therefore abſolutely neceſſary to the production of every creature; and though the conditions which he hath ordained be abſolutely neceſſary to the generation of every creature, yet are not theſe conditions alwaies performed from any abſolute neceſſity of the part of God, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from contingent cauſes and the will of the creature: For example, it is neceſſary that the influence of the Sun from matter diſpoſed in ſtanding pools; ſhould produce Frogs, yet are not alwaies thoſe Pooles neceſſary to be, but are often made, and often filled up, from voluntary and contingent cauſes of man; ſo <hi>contactus naturalis</hi> in bodies apted and diſpoſed doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily generate; yet is there no neceſſity that this <hi>contactus</hi> ſhould bee, but it might not have beene, &amp;c. Univerſall cauſes in nature produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of themſelves but as meeting with particular and materiall cauſes diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to production, the univerſall cauſes are alwaies prime and neceſſary, but their meeting with particular cauſes are not alwaies ſo, but often times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent and voluntary.</p>
                        <p>As God, by the confluence of naturall cauſes, is alwaies the firſt cauſe of all creatures by Generation, ſo is he the firſt cauſe of the preſervation of all Creatures; yet doth not he preſerve them by any abſolute neceſſity of his part alone, but by ſuch meanes as he hath ordained for every Creature; I ſay this meanes doth not alwaies come to paſſe from inevitable neceſſity of the part of God, but often times from the will of men, and contingent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for example, no man lives but as he daily repaires nature by eating and drinking, yet there is no neceſſity that he ſhould eat or drink, but he may chooſe whether he will or not.</p>
                        <p>Nor is God leſs the prime preſerver of intellectuall and rationall creatures; yet doth he not preſerve them as other creatures void of underſtanding, but thus uſing the intellectuall and rationall faculty of their Soul, yet there is no man but may chuſe whether he will uſe his underſtanding and reaſon in his actions and that man who doth not uſe his underſtanding in his actions but only his affections and paſſions, how great ſoever he be, will live to ſee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery enough.</p>
                        <p>And though Religion and Juſtice cannot of themſelves preſerve men in Peace and Happineſſe, but ſome ſuperior cauſe which muſt order and diſpoſe them thereunto, yet ſo neceſſary are they for the preſervation of peace and happineſs, that wherſoever they are neglected, men did ever degenerate into ſtraction, confuſion and prophaneneſſe; this ſuperior cauſe which dignifies men above all other creatures, as well intellectuall as ſociable, is God, who is the prime, efficient and neceſſary cauſe of peace and happineſſe among ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Creatures; and Religion and Juſtice are the neceſſary meanes which he hath ordained therefore. But though Religion and Juſtice be neceſſary for the peace and happineſſe of any Nation, yet is it not alwaies neceſſary on Gods part men ſhould be Religious and Juſt, but men may chuſe whether they will do religious and juſt acts or not; God therefore is the firſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary cauſe of peace and happineſſe among men, and Religion and Juſtice the neceſſary meanes which he hath ordained thereunto, and this to be performed by man; and let no man thinke that God will ſave any man in this world, or bleſſe him in the world to come againſt his Will, when men will not endeavor theſe things by ſuch meanes as hee hath ordained; Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Religion and Juſtice ought to endeavour, through God's bleſſing to attaine to Peace and Happineſſe as well in this World, as in the next,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:200520:198"/> without which hee cannot reaſonably hope for eyther.</p>
                        <p>Having thus far treated of the cauſes of all ſociety, and vindicated the Government and Lawes of my native Country, and mother-Church of <hi>England;</hi> It will not be amiſſe before I conclude to add a word or two in vindication of Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> my moſt honored Anceſtor, ſince by words and writing he is ſo traduced, (as indeed <hi>Quis ille a tergo quem nulla aconia pinſit?)</hi> by men ſo maliciouſly or ignorantly, or both. Among the reſt one (a late wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Pamphlet, I will not call it becauſe of the ſubject, being the life of our late Soveraigne, yet it is without name, although I thinke few men but are ſufficiently aſſured of the Author) upon a ſeditious and reproachfull ſpeech, he ſayes tending to the diſhonour of his Majeſties Government, made by Mr. <hi>Coke,</hi> after the wonted rate of his laviſh pen, without any more adoe makes him a Chip of the old Block. But of all men I am content he next after one of our <hi>Mercuries</hi> ſhould ſay it, ſince if he be not traduced unjuſtly hee can aſperſe the Nobility upon the faith of a <hi>Mercury;</hi> and ſo many others upon none at all: and his Quotations upon his Geography, So fals that upon ſearch made by a Reader, and ſcarce any to be found to be true, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing he blotted out the pages, and only quoted the Authors, and left the Reader to finde them where he could: If theſe be true, then certainly his <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> is of ſmall account; if falſe then let him deny them.</p>
                        <p>But I can tell our Hiſtorian newes of his Soldier, whom he <hi>page</hi> 156. made openly to be ſhot to death in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church yard, for as is confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported and beleeved he was apprehended about <hi>Whitehall, June</hi> 17. and is at this time in faire election of being hanged. And being no leſſe a more famous Geographer then Hiſtorian (though his ſecond Edition ſuffers much for want of his expunged pages to finde out his quotations) hee <hi>page</hi> 123. makes the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Conway</hi> a place of principall command on that narrow channell which runs between the County of <hi>Carnarvan</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey:</hi> whereas the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Conway</hi> ſtand upon the River <hi>Conway,</hi> which parts <hi>Denbighſhire</hi> from <hi>Carnarvanſhire,</hi> a little below the mouth of the River <hi>Geſſen:</hi> nay, let any man ſee whether the River <hi>Conway</hi> falls not into the Iriſh or Virgivium Sea; but whether it fals into the Iriſh or Virgivium Sea or not: yet certainly it cannot fall into the narrow Channell which parts <hi>Carnarvanſhire</hi> from <hi>Angleſey,</hi> which begins at <hi>Abermenay</hi> ferry, and ends at <hi>Porthathir</hi> ferry, whereas the mouth of <hi>Conway</hi> is little leſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Porthathir</hi> ferry, then that is from <hi>Abermenay, Porthathir</hi> ferry being upon the matter equidiſtant from either. What heed then is to be taken to the <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> of ſuch a Geographer and Hiſtorian let any man Judge; Sure he had more need mend his own Errors, then be ſo raſh and laviſh a Cenſurer of other mens.</p>
                        <p>Although I take not this mans tongue to be any ſlander, &amp; ſo not worth an anſwering, or at moſt a bare denyall of what he ſayes were ſufficient, which I doe, ſince it is but <hi>gratis dictum;</hi> yet ſince other men have aſſumed to themſelves ſuch licence of aſperſing him, it will not ill become mee to ſhew how unjuſtly he is aſperſed in thoſe things whereof they traduce him; as firſt this man makes him a ſeditious man, certainly it is very ſtrange that in the living of 83 yeeres, the many of his writings, and his many imployments, doth not produce ſo much as any ſuſpicion thereof, that I ever heard of. One thing yet pleaſes me, that in all theſe ſeditious commotions, Judge <hi>Jenkins</hi>
                           <pb n="267" facs="tcp:200520:198"/> and almoſt all the aſſertors of the Kings Cauſe, have next after Divine Laws, maintained it principally out of his writings: nor doe I remember that any of the adverſe part (I am ſure not truly) have ever made uſe of any thing in his writings to their advantage: certainly therefore in his writings he was no ſeditious man: but it may be our reverend Hiſtorian, though blinde, yet ſees more then any body elſe.</p>
                        <p>It is true indeede that he lived in disfavour with two Kings, yet as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not ſubjects to diſpute the actions of Prince, ſo is no man therefore to be cenſured becauſe in disfavour; often times the beſt of Princes have not things and men truly repreſented to them. This I am ſure of having ſo powerfull opponents at Court, if any crime, much leſſe then that of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could have been found againſt him, it would have beene improved to the utmoſt advantage; nor did he neglect to be reconciled to his chiefeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and to that purpoſe married his youngeſt daughter to his brother, being in perſon and fortune little inferior to any Subject of her time, which did him no good.</p>
                        <p>Othermen (though little verſed in the things they lay to his charge) doeſay in the generall, That in his writings he was no friend to eyther King or Church.</p>
                        <p>This is ſo generall a charge as no particular anſwere can be given to it; yet thus much may be ſaid, that being a Lawyer by profeſſion, I hope it is not to be a crime in any Subject, much leſſe in him, to be a lover and honourer of the Lawes: but being a Subject, and no Legiſlator, and commenting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Laws, he muſt comment upon the Lawes as they were made, hee could not make them better nor worſe; if Lawes made were derogatory to eyther Crowne or Church, it was the vice of the times, and no fault of his.</p>
                        <p>Yet I have often heard that hee was the firſt Grantor; and a great favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of Prohibitions, to the utter ruine of all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction.</p>
                        <p>How unjuſt the firſt charge is, there is no man any way verſed in our Lawes but muſt needs underſtand; and for the latter, if any one can ſhew wherein he ſo far favored them, that he ever granted any not warrantable by the Law, and they ſay ſomthing.</p>
                        <p>For his care of the Church, it ſufficiently appeareth in his endeavoring the paſſing of a Law, that every Patron ſhould be ſworn, as well as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent againſt Simony; and alſo that Patron who ſhould Symonically pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote any Clerke, ſhould not only forfeit that avoydance, but the advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the King; as alſo when upon pretence of concealement the Deane and Chapters Lands of <hi>Northwich</hi> were begged of the King, he did not only free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proffer the Chapter to have defended their cauſe, in perſon, though then very aged, but ſtated it and gave it them in writing, to be kept for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in caſe any after that pretence might be made, which was preſerved by the Deane and Chapter among their Archives untill the generall deluge of our late diſſention ſwallowed up this among their other things: and ſo grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an acknowledgment did the Society make, that upon his next Progreſſe into <hi>Norfolke,</hi> they deſired that he would lay his bones in that Cathedrall, whoſe right he had ſo defended.</p>
                        <p>So devout a Son he was of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the obſervation of the Rites and Liturgy thereof, that I am confident that in neere forty yeers before his death, if ſickneſſe or publick imployment, or ſomthing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinardy not divert him; ſcarce one day paſſed wherein he was not twice a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:200520:199"/> aſſiſtant in the offering up of the publique Service of the Church: nor was he leſſe ſevere to himſelfe in his perſon, then juſt to his publick imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being never ſo much as ſuſpected of any notorious or ſcandalous vice. Theſe virtues and his learned labours; (wherein he has as well deſerved of his Country as any man before him) ſhall erect him a monument of ſame to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when as the malice and ignorance of his adverſaries ſhall be forgotten.</p>
                        <p>For mine owne part, it is true, that I have ultimately reſolved my ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as a man, and my faith as a Chriſtian into two principles, the one into the Law of Nature, the other into the Scriptures; <hi>Dominium fundatur in natura,</hi> at no time or place did ever men live out of Society, and Dominion is neceſſary to Society; but faith is divinely revealed in the Scripture, and this hapned in ſucceſſion of time, neyther is it yet received by neer one tenth part of mankinde, nor will I ever hope to mend what God hath made: It is therefore an idle thing to object <hi>Imperium</hi> in <hi>Imperio</hi> againſt it, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the objection to any purpoſe or underſtood by the objectors, for it is the ſame God which hath engraven lawes of Nature in the mindes of men, and who hath divinely revealed himſelfe in the Scriptures: not is there any thing in either, which is repugnant on contrary, but rather the one doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and ſupport the other; there is no better plea for mens ſubjection to eyther Kings, Fathers or Maſters then is contained in the Scriptures: nor doth Chriſtianity any waies repugne the Regality of Princes, but it is as entire over the perſons of all men, in all Caſes, as where men are not Chriſtian. Were not thoſe the beſt Chriſtians who in the primitive times lived under heathen Emperors and perſecutors without any civil diſturbance on their parts? and cannot Chriſtians be as good under Chriſtian Kings; or is the caſe of Kings worſe for their being Chriſtian. Let any one ſhew me any thing in all the Scriptures which doth countenance ſedition and I will abjure my Chriſtianity; yet I will ſhew him almoſt infinite places, which without all contradiction commands obedience to higher Powers. They are therefore Wolves in Sheeps clothing, who abuſe that ghoſtly Power left us by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for the benefit of mans ſalvation into licentiouſneſs againſt their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obedience, due as well by the Law of Nature, as thoſe by divine poſitive inſtitution (as if men being qualified to perform the acts of Ghoſtly power, were free from naturall ſubjection, which as Prieſts they ought to preach as Gods Ordinance, <hi>R.</hi> 13.) &amp; deſerve rather to perſecuted to death, then obeyed when they do ſo: and by conſequence Maſter <hi>Hobbs</hi> underſtands not himſelf when hee makes his convenient argument againſt Chriſtianity, upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <note place="margin">

                           </note> that if one man may command the ſame thing upon the penalty of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death, and another forbid it upon pain of eternall, the whole ſtructure of his <hi>civitas</hi> might be diſſolved, which is no great matter if it were.</p>
                        <p>But, I pray, what doe thoſe men doe which reſolve all ſubjection into the <hi>civitas,</hi> and the <hi>civitas</hi> into the civil part, and the civil part into the wills of men, into <hi>do</hi> or <hi>dedi,</hi> and not <hi>dabo</hi> or <hi>faciam;</hi> which make the Lawes of Nature voluntary and depending upon the wills of men; which make this <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas</hi> made by the wills of men ſuperiour to the Law of Nature, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to command any thing contrary to it, and yet (as ridiculouſly as blaſpemouſly) make tyranny to be only <hi>ab exercitio;</hi> which make not only all Lawes of Nature but the Ghoſtly power ordained by Chriſt, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, inſtrumentall and ſubſervient to it, and by conſequence all Lawes of Nature and Divine Inſtitution in the Scriptures to be ſubſervient to this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary

                        <p>Reader, theſe obſervations and Elements were deſigned to have come forth ſome moneths ſooner then now, which in regard of the ſlowneſſe of the preſſe I could not accompliſh; and many of the ſheets were printed off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſtauration of his Majeſty, wherein the calamity of this Nation are mentioned, and wherein I have endeavored to demonſtrate that there was no viſible meanes under heaven to cure them but his Majeſties reſtitution. If in endeavoring to ſhew that the originall cauſes of our diſtempers were as unjuſt as the continuance of them, I have rubbed ſome ſores which are not convenient to be touched at this time: I ſay that it is impoſſible for any man to cure any malady, who firſt doth not inquire into the cauſes; and thoſe were printed off in our diſtractions and diſcompoſures. If any thing herein may conduce to the glory of God, the good and Peace of my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as either advancing the Chriſtian Religion, or the Peace and Proſperity of it, I ſhall give God the glory, and thus far account my ſelfe a happy man, that I have not only lived to my ſelfe but imployed my time in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the benefit of other men:</p>
